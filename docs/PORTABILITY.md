# IWE Portability

## Quick Answer: Look at the Layer

IWE is divided into three layers. The layer determines how tightly a rule is bound to the platform:

| Layer | Where | Platform Dependency |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **L1** — platform | CLAUDE.md §1–7, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/` | **Bound to Claude Code and macOS** |
| **L2** — staging | CLAUDE.md §8 | Partially specific |
| **L3** — personal | `extensions/`, `params.yaml`, CLAUDE.md §9 | **Universal — your logic** |

**Rule:** when you encounter an instruction, check which layer it belongs to. L3 does not need changes. L1 requires changes when switching platforms.

## Kimi Code (VS Code)

**Works out of the box — no additional configuration required.**

1. Install the Kimi Code extension in VS Code.
2. Open the forked Repository — Kimi will automatically pick up `AGENTS.md` from the root.
3. Work as usual: Kimi reads all instructions from `AGENTS.md`.

**Customization for Kimi:** place your instructions in `extensions/` or in `AGENTS-agent-blocks.md`. They will be included in `AGENTS.md` after running `bash scripts/sync-agent-instructions.sh`. Do not edit `AGENTS.md` manually — it will be overwritten.

**What does not work through Kimi:** Skills (`/day-open`, `/ke`, `/archgate`) and Hooks — these are Claude Code CLI mechanisms. Claude Code is required for them.

## Hermes Agent

Two ways to connect Aisystant MCP — choose whichever is convenient:

**Option A — through the Interface:**
1. Settings → MCP Servers → Add → Aisystant.
2. Log in via Ory (a browser will open).

**Option B — through CLI:**
```bash
hermes mcp login aisystant
```
If an OAuth error appears, run `hermes mcp update aisystant` or check `hermes --help mcp`.

After connecting, Hermes will automatically receive instructions through the `get_instructions` tool.

**Important:** Hermes does not read Repository files directly (unlike Claude Code and Kimi Code). It receives all instructions through MCP, not from `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`.

## What Depends on Claude Code

If you use Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, or another assistant (not Kimi and not Hermes) — the following L1 Components require replacement or adaptation:

- **CLAUDE.md format** — read by Claude Code on startup. Kimi reads `AGENTS.md` (already in the Template). Other assistants use different formats (`.cursorrules`, system prompt, etc.)
- **`.claude/hooks/`** — events (pre-commit, post-tool) — Claude Code CLI mechanism
- **Skills and slash-commands** (`/day-open`, `/ke`, `/archgate`) — work only inside Claude Code
- **MCP servers** — Hermes supports them. Other assistants — depends on implementation.
- **Model selection** (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku) — specific to Anthropic API

**What transfers without changes:** Opening/Work/Closing Protocols as concepts, Pack/DS/Base Architecture, memory and capture logic, everything in `extensions/` and `params.yaml`.

---

## What Depends on macOS

If you are on Linux or Windows (WSL) — the following L1 Components require replacement:

| Component | macOS | Linux / WSL |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Automation timers | `launchd` + `.plist` | `systemd` timer or `cron` |
| Laptop wake | `pmset repeat wakeorpoweron` | `rtcwake` / `WakeSystem=true` |
| `/transcribe` transcription | MLX Whisper (Apple Silicon) | Model replacement required |
| Paths | `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, Homebrew paths | Standard Linux paths |

`setup.sh` detects the OS automatically and skips macOS steps on Linux. Technical details for contributors: [PLATFORM-COMPAT.md](PLATFORM-COMPAT.md).

## What Is Universal (Do Not Modify)

Regardless of platform and AI assistant — the following works without changes:

- **Opening/Work/Closing fractal** (Opening → Work → Closing) — a principle, not a tool
- **Pack / DS / Base Architecture** — organization of Knowledge in files
- **Memory and Capture** — Knowledge capture logic
- **Protocols** (Day Open, Week Close, Strategy Session) — as concepts
- **All of L3:** `extensions/`, `params.yaml`, personal Distinctions

---

## How to Adapt to Another Platform

1. Transfer L3 (`extensions/`, `params.yaml`) without changes — this is your logic
2. Rewrite L1 for the new assistant's format (system prompt, `.cursorrules`, etc.)
3. Protocol concepts (Opening/Work/Closing, Pack, capture) — describe in the new format: they are platform-neutral

## Adding Support for a New Agent

> For developers who want to integrate an agent not yet listed here.

IWE is not bound to any specific LLM or agent. Any agent that satisfies the minimum Host contract will work with IWE without changes to the Pack, Protocols, or L3.

### Minimum Host Contract

| Requirement | Purpose | Level |
|---|---|---|
| Reads instruction file from project | CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / system prompt | **Required** |
| Tool use: edits files, runs commands | code edits, Protocol Scripts | **Required** |
| MCP support | Aisystant cloud: Knowledge, Persona, Digital Twin | Optional |
| Headless / CLI mode | automations (cron, Hooks) | Optional |

Without MCP the agent works autonomously — only the cloud Knowledge layer is lost.
Without headless mode — manual launch instead of schedule.

### How to Add an Adapter

1. **Create an instruction file** — an adapter for the agent to read. Examples:
   - Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`
   - Kimi Code reads `AGENTS.md` (generated from CLAUDE.md by the `sync-agent-instructions.sh` Script)
   - Hermes receives instructions through MCP `get_instructions`
   - Cursor — `.cursorrules`, Copilot — system prompt through `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

2. **Add the agent to `setup.sh`** — include the CLI command name in `AI_CLI_CANDIDATES` (via env or hardcoded in the Script).

3. **Document it** — add a section to this file (PORTABILITY.md) following the Kimi Code and Hermes Agent examples above.

4. **Pull requests are welcome** — if you want to add an agent for all IWE users.
