# Release Audit Log

> Adversarial post-release audits. Process: after each release, an auto-issue `Post-release adversarial audit: vX.Y.Z` is now migrated into this table. Trigger: `verify-before-promote.sh` warn gate fires on PASS-merge with no entry in the log.

## Purpose

Adversarial audit — a sub-agent or external pilot searches for regressions outside the existing coverage:
- 8 detectors (`integration-detectors.sh`)
- smoke 14 (`integration-smoke.sh`)
- promote-checks (`validate-fmt-scripts.sh`)

Any discovered regression class → new detector in `integration-detectors.sh` (if reproducible in CI) or smoke (if it requires a pilot environment).

## Process

```
release tag vX.Y.Z → auto-issue (legacy) | new practice → entry here
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `version` | Release tag (vX.Y.Z) |
| `status` | `pending` / `in-progress` / `completed` / `skipped-unverified` |
| `date` | Audit date (YYYY-MM-DD) or `—` |
| `findings` | Number of findings or `—` |
| `result` | Cross-reference: PR/commit/issue with fixes or `—` |
| `notes` | Migration source or additional info |

## Log

## Hidden Observation From Migrated Issues

During a spot-check of migrated issues (peer-session [2026-06-01-18](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/DS-my-strategy/tree/main/sessions/2026-06/2026-06-01-18-fmt-issues-triage-verify)), the following was discovered: M-checklist #75 (M1.6) contains confirmation that **the adversarial audit on 2026-05-06 found 40 findings and all of them were fixed** (status: ✅ Fixed for C1-C4, H2, ...). This means one of the migrated audits was actually conducted — it is not "skipped-unverified", it is **completed with no entry in the public log**. The entry has been restored in the `v0.29.x (round-2)` row.

## Ongoing Use

- Each new release → one row in this table (instead of an auto-issue).
- `verify-before-promote.sh` warn-gate: if a promotion is attempted with no entry for the previous release — warning (not a block).
- Once per quarter — review the log: `skipped-unverified` entries older than 90 days → make a decision (run-now / accept-debt / wontfix).
