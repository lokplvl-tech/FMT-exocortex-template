# IWE Learning Path

> **IWE (Intellectual Work Environment)** — an intelligent work environment, analogous to an IDE for developing thinking. Just as an IDE gives a programmer an editor, compiler, linter, and debugger — IWE gives a person formalized knowledge (Pack), automatic extraction (Extractor), correctness verification (FPF/SPF), and gap diagnostics (Digital Twin). The person works together with AI agents, each of which plays its own Role.

## How to use this file

1. **Beginner:** Sections 1–2 (what IWE is, Architecture). Approximately 1 hour. You will understand how everything works.
2. **First week:** Sections 3–5 (foundation, Repositories, daily work). As needed.
3. **Active user:** Sections 6–8 (Knowledge, agents, quality). When you start creating Pack.
4. **Advanced:** Sections 9–10 (Platform, growth). When you want to scale.
5. **Reference:** Section 11 — quick answers.

> **Terminology:** IWE = intelligent work environment, described through 5 architectural viewpoints: systems, descriptions, Roles, Methods, Work Products (§ 1.2). Triad A.7: Role → Method → Work Product. Exocortex = the description storage system inside IWE (CLAUDE.md + memory/).

## 1. What is IWE

### 1.1. Definition

IWE is a personal system for intellectual work and development. Just as an IDE unifies an editor, compiler, and debugger into one environment for a programmer — IWE unifies Knowledge, planning, and AI agents into one environment for thinking.

### 1.1a. Core principle: exoskeleton, not prosthesis

> DP.ARCH.001 principle #21. Full detail: [DP.IWE.001 §5.1](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/PACK-digital-platform/blob/main/pack/digital-platform/02-domain-entities/DP.IWE.001-intelligent-working-environment.md).

IWE amplifies the user's thinking — it does not replace it. The Distinction:

- **Prosthesis:** AI thinks for you → the task is solved, but you did not learn → atrophy
- **Exoskeleton:** you think for yourself, AI amplifies → the task is solved + you became more Competent → growth

Three exoskeleton mechanisms in IWE:

1. **Surfacing, not generating.** The AI shows your own Knowledge (Pack, memory/, Digital Twin) at the right moment. You do the thinking.
2. **Questions, not answers** (in strategic decisions). WP Gate requires planning before action. Consultation T2-T3 asks "what do you think?" in response to lazy requests.
3. **Fading scaffolding.** Training: more assistance at beginner levels, less at advanced levels. Tiers T0→T4: from direct answers to co-thinking.

**Criterion:** after interacting with IWE, the user has become more Competent — not merely received a result.

### 1.2. IWE anatomy: five architectural viewpoints

IWE as a system is examined from five viewpoints (ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010): systems, descriptions, Roles, Methods, and Work Products. The central organizing principle is FPF triad A.7: **Role → Method → Work Product**.

> **Three IWE classifications:** Viewpoints (this section) answer "through which lens are we looking." Perimeters L1–L4 (§ 2.1) answer "where it lives." Tiers T0-T4 + TM/TA/TD (§ 9.1) answer "what level of access."

#### Viewpoint 1: Systems (U.System) — what has 4D boundaries

Systems with boundaries, inputs, outputs, and an owner. Can be started, stopped, and updated. The primary IWE systems are listed here; additional systems (WakaTime and others) are described in § 2.6.

| System | Type | What it does | Perimeter (§ 2.1) |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code CLI** (A1) | LLM agent | Primary AI executor: code, analysis, planning | L4 Personal |
| **Telegram bot** (I1, @aist_me_bot) | Service | Notes, programs, Digital Twin, notifications | L2 Platform |
| **MCP servers** (I3-I8) | Protocol | Access to Pack, guides, DS descriptions from Claude Code | L2 Platform |
| **Git + GitHub** | VCS | Versioning, storage, CI | L3 Template / L4 |
| **Exocortex** | File system | Storage and delivery of descriptions (CLAUDE.md + memory/) | L3 Template / L4 |
| **Neon DB** (Digital Twin) | DBMS | Storage of Digital Twin events | L2 Platform |

> **Test:** Does it have 4D boundaries, an owner, inputs and outputs? → System.
>
> **Exocortex** is visible from two viewpoints. Through the "Systems" lens: a file system with a lifecycle (Open/Close), an owner, and boundaries. Through the "Descriptions" lens: the content of those files — Distinctions, principles, Protocols. Not two objects, but two perspectives on one object (ISO 42010).
>
> **Neon DB** — similarly. Through the "Systems" lens: a running DBMS with 4D boundaries (HD #27: the bot is a client, not an owner). Through the "Work Products" lens: the events recorded in that DBMS.

Roles (Viewpoint 3) are launched automatically through the OS system scheduler: launchd (macOS) or cron (Linux). The scheduler is not part of IWE — it is operating system Infrastructure. It is set up once during setup.

#### Viewpoint 2: Descriptions (U.Description) — Knowledge loaded into systems

Text descriptions that are loaded into AI context and define its behavior. They are not executed — they are read.

| Description | Composition | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Principles** (FPF, SPF, ZP) | Encoded in the exocortex and prompts | Principles of correct thinking, fallback chain |
| **Exocortex content** | `CLAUDE.md` + `MEMORY.md` + `memory/*.md` | Rules, Distinctions, SOTA, navigation |
| **Pack entities** | `PACK-{domain}/pack/**/*.md` | Formalized Domain descriptions (source-of-truth) |
| **Role prompts** | `roles/*/prompts/*.md` | Role Configuration: day-plan, week-review, session-close, and others |

> **Test:** Can it be passed as a file and loaded into a system? → Description.

#### Viewpoint 3: Roles (U.RoleAssignment) — functions independent of the performer

A Role describes the function (WHAT to do), not the performer (WHO does it). One Role Performer (holder) can play multiple Roles. One Role can be played by different performers (Claude, a bash script, a person). More detail: [DP.ROLE.001 §3](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/PACK-digital-platform/blob/main/pack/digital-platform/02-domain-entities/DP.ROLE.001-platform-roles.md).

| Role | Code | Performer (holder) | What it does | When |
|------|------|--------------------|-------------|------|
| **Strategist** | R1 | Claude CLI (on schedule) | Planning, reflection, session preparation | Every morning, evening, week |
| **Extractor** | R2 | Claude CLI | Extracting descriptions into Pack | On Close, on demand, every 3 h |
| **Synchronizer** | R8 | bash script (on schedule) | Schedule coordination, notifications, nightly review | On schedule |
| **Guide** | R13 | Telegram bot | Navigating users through Platform services | When a user requests |
| **User** | — | Human | Decision-making, creation, reflection | Always |

> **Test:** Is it a function describable without naming a performer? → Role.
>
> **Role ≠ Performer (HD #5).** The notation "Strategist (R1) ← Claude" reads: Role is Strategist, holder is Claude. "Human" is not a Role — it is a performer playing the "User" Role.
>
> **FPF notation:** `Holder#Role:Context@Window` (A.2). Full catalog: 21 Platform Roles in DP.ROLE.001 §3.2.

#### Viewpoint 4: Methods (U.MethodDescription) — how a Role produces a Work Product

Method descriptions (procedures defining "how to do it") that link a Role to a Work Product. They have their own lifecycle, owners, and correctness tests.

| Method | What it describes | Owner Role | Work Product |
|--------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| **OWC Protocol** | Open → Work → Close of each Session | All Roles | WP context, plans, reports |
| **Capture-to-Pack** | Knowledge extraction at Work milestones | R2 Extractor | Pack entities |
| **ArchGate** (EMOSSS) | Evaluation of architectural decisions by 7 characteristics | R1 Strategist | Evaluation table, decision |
| **Knowledge Extraction** (KE) | Transformation of raw data into Pack entities | R2 Extractor | Pack entities |
| **Note-Review** | Processing notes, routing to appropriate Repositories | R1 Strategist | Sorted notes, tasks |

> **Test:** Is it a "how to do it" procedure, describable independently of the performer? → Method.
>
> **Why a separate viewpoint?** Triad A.7 (Role → Method → Work) is the central Distinction of FPF. Without the "Methods" viewpoint, Protocols get lost in Descriptions, even though they are not just Knowledge — they are **procedures** that connect Roles to Work Products.

#### Viewpoint 5: Work Products (U.Work) — what is produced

Observable Work Products. They can be read, verified, versioned, and passed to another person without explanation.

| Work Product | Where | Who produces it | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Strategy hub** | `DS-strategy/` | R1 Strategist + User | Storing personal documents (plans, strategy, inbox) and running strategy Sessions |
| **Pack documents** | `PACK-{domain}/` | R2 Extractor + User | Accumulating formalized Domain descriptions (the sole source-of-truth) |
| **Project repositories** | `DS-{projects}/` | User + Claude Code | Creating concrete products: code, bots, courses, content |
| **Digital Twin events** | Neon DB | Bot + LMS + Club | Personalization and reflection: Profile, Progress, self-assessment |
| **Notes** | `DS-strategy/inbox/` | Bot (from Telegram) | Quick capture of thoughts and observations for subsequent Strategist processing |
| **Posts, drafts** | `DS-strategy/drafts/`, Knowledge Index | User | Crystallizing thoughts and publishing |

> **Test:** Can it be handed to another person without explanation? Does it persist after work ends? → Work Product.

#### How the viewpoints connect

```
         Role ──method──→ Method ──produces──→ Work Product
              ↑                                      │
         Descriptions                         Capture-to-Pack
         are loaded into Roles                back into Descriptions
              ↑
         Systems
         execute Roles

Example chains (Role → Method → Work Product):
  R1 Strategist ──── OWC ──────────────── WeekPlan, DayPlan
  R2 Extractor ───── Capture-to-Pack ──── Pack entities
  R1 Strategist ──── Note-Review ─────── Sorted notes
  User ───────────── ArchGate ─────────── EMOSSS table + decision
```

> **Integrity principle:** Remove any viewpoint — and IWE degrades. Without systems — no execution. Without descriptions — a stateless assistant. Without Roles — task chaos. Without Methods — ad hoc work. Without Work Products — no result.

### 1.3. User journey

```
T axis (learner):
T0 No Ory           T1 Start            T2 Learning         T3 Personalization   T4 Creation (IWE)
├── /start in bot   ├── Ory registration ├── Programs         ├── Digital Twin      ├── setup.sh
├── telegram_id     ├── UUID             ├── Marathon         ├── Profile + goals   ├── Claude Code
├── 30-day trial    ├── 30-day trial     ├── Bot + content    ├── Mentor            ├── Strategist + plans
└── Basic search    └── Assistant        └── Expert           └── Mentor            └── Co-thinker

Orthogonal axes (assigned):
TM1-TM3: Mentor    TA1-TA4: Administrator    TD1: Developer
```

**Key point:** T0–T3 work without Git — everything is done through the bot. T4 adds Claude Code, Git, and automated agents. TD1 (developer) is an orthogonal axis: access to source code, Deployment, and architectural decisions. Owner = T4 + TA4 + TD1. The transition is gradual — everything previously accumulated (Digital Twin, Profile, Progress) is preserved.

**Central IWE invariant:** Platform updates (Standard) **never** affect user data (Personal). Your plans, Knowledge, and strategy belong to you.

## 2. Architecture: perimeters and spaces

### 2.1. Four system perimeters

IWE does not exist in isolation — it is part of a 4-perimeter system. Each perimeter corresponds to its own level in the principles hierarchy (§ 3.1):

```
L1: Ecosystem    — the entire system: Platform + community + all IWE users
  L2: Platform   — Infrastructure and services (bot, MCP, Knowledge Index)
    L3: Template — this Template (CLAUDE.md + memory/ + Strategist + seed/)
      L4: Personal IWE — your instance (configured, with personal Pack and data)
```

| Perimeter | What it means for you | Example | How it is updated |
|-----------|-----------------------|---------|------------------|
| **L1: Ecosystem** | Community, seminars, content | systemsworld.club, Telegram channels | You participate |
| **L2: Platform** | Services you connect to | Bot @aist_me_bot, Knowledge Index | Updated by the developer |
| **L3: Template** | The Template from which your IWE was created | This repository (FMT-exocortex-template) | `update.sh` — Platform-space |
| **L4: Personal IWE** | Your work, plans, Knowledge | ~/IWE/CLAUDE.md, DS-strategy/ | Only you (User-space) |

**Where to study:**
- [ONTOLOGY.md](../ONTOLOGY.md) § "System perimeters"
- `DS-ecosystem-development/11-platform-contours.md` — full architectural model (ecosystem governance repository, created locally during Deployment, not published on GitHub)

### 2.2. From Template to workspace

#### FMT-exocortex-template repository structure

```

```

#### Four zones

| Zone | What | update.sh | User |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| **PLATFORM** | `CLAUDE.md` (§1-7), `memory/protocol-*.md`, `roles/`, `docs/`, `.claude/` | Updates | Does not modify |
| **USER-SPACE** | `CLAUDE.md` § "My rules" (section `<!-- USER-SPACE -->`) | **Does not modify** | Own rules, Distinctions |
| **CONFIG** | `memory/day-rhythm-config.yaml` | Does not modify | Configures parameters |
| **PERSONAL** | `memory/MEMORY.md`, AUTHOR-ONLY zones in Protocols | Does not modify | Edits |
| **SEED** | `seed/strategy/` | N/A | After setup → separate repository DS-strategy/ |

> **USER-SPACE** — the "8. My rules" section at the end of CLAUDE.md. Add your own rules, Distinctions, and lessons only here — they are preserved during updates. Everything above (§1-7) is Platform content and is updated via `update.sh`.
> **AUTHOR-ONLY zones** — blocks inside PLATFORM files, marked with `<!-- AUTHOR-ONLY -->` markers. They are preserved during update.sh. Details: [CLAUDE.md §7](../CLAUDE.md).

#### What setup.sh does

1. Forks the Template → your GitHub account
2. Substitutes 7 placeholders (`{{GITHUB_USER}}`, `{{WORKSPACE_DIR}}`, and others)
3. Copies `CLAUDE.md` → workspace root directory
4. Copies `memory/*.md` → `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`
5. Creates `DS-strategy/` from `seed/strategy/` (separate private repository)
6. Installs launchd agents for the Strategist

#### Workspace after setup

```
~/IWE/
├── CLAUDE.md                          # read every Session (auto)
├── DS-strategy/                       # ★ daily: plans, inbox, strategy
│   ├── current/DayPlan, WeekPlan      # Strategist writes, you read
│   ├── inbox/WP-*.md                  # task contexts
│   └── docs/Strategy.md              # your strategy
├── FMT-exocortex-template/            # DO NOT modify (updated via update.sh)
├── PACK-{domain}/                     # when created: domain knowledge
└── DS-{projects}/                     # when created: code, tools
```

### 2.3. What the Platform provides through the Template (Standard)

Through the Template and updates, you receive a ready-made methodology:

| Component | What it is | Files |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Protocols** | Open → Work → Close: how to run a Session | `memory/protocol-*.md` |
| **Memory** | 11 files: Distinctions, SOTA, Roles, checklists, navigation | `memory/*.md` |
| **Strategist** | 7 automatic planning Scenarios | `roles/strategist/prompts/` |
| **Tools** | WakaTime hook, Claude Code skills | `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/` |
| **Rules** | Repository Architecture, processes, gates | `CLAUDE.md` |

All of this is updated via `update.sh` — you receive improvements without losing personal data.

### 2.4. What accumulates for you (Personal)

Your data lives separately and is **never affected by updates**:

| Layer | What | Where | How it grows |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Fleeting notes** | Momentary notes | `DS-strategy/inbox/fleeting-notes.md` | Bot: ".text" |
| **Captures** | Captured Knowledge | `DS-strategy/inbox/captures.md` | Claude: Capture-to-Pack |
| **Memory** | Tasks, lessons, navigation | `MEMORY.md` | Claude updates every Session |
| **Configuration** | Behavior parameters | `memory/day-rhythm-config.yaml` | You configure |
| **AUTHOR-ONLY zones** | Your Protocol extensions | `memory/protocol-*.md` | You add |
| **Pack entities** | Formalized Knowledge | `PACK-{domain}/` | Extractor formalizes captures |
| **Content** | Posts, courses | `DS-{projects}/` | You create |

#### Three customization patterns (L3 → L4)

| Pattern | Mechanism | Example | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Config** | yaml file with parameters | `strategy_day: saturday` | Agent behavior settings |
| **AUTHOR-ONLY zones** | HTML markers in Protocols | Checks for specific systems | Extending Protocols without conflicts with update.sh |
| **Placeholders** | `{{WORKSPACE_DIR}}` and others | Paths, GitHub username | Auto-substitution during setup |

More detail on AUTHOR-ONLY zones: [CLAUDE.md §7](../CLAUDE.md).

### 2.5. Updates: update.sh

**One command:** `cd ~/IWE/FMT-exocortex-template && bash update.sh`

The Script downloads the update Manifest from GitHub, compares sha256 hashes of local files with upstream, shows a preview, and applies changes after confirmation:

| Step | What it does | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 0. Self-update | Checks whether a new version of update.sh exists | Script is always current |
| 1. Manifest | Downloads `update-manifest.json` from GitHub | List of files for updating |
| 2. Comparison | sha256 of local files vs remote | List of new and changed items |
| 3. Preview | Shows: new files, updated files, untouched files | You decide: apply or not |
| 4. Application | Downloads and replaces files, substitutes variables | Platform files updated |
| 5. Platform-space | Copies CLAUDE.md → workspace, memory/ → ~/.claude/ | Live files updated |
| 6. Roles | Reinstalls Roles if their files changed | Agents updated |

**What is NOT affected:**

```
CLAUDE.md § "My rules"      ← USER-SPACE section (your rules and Distinctions)
MEMORY.md                   ← Your Work Product table
DS-strategy/                ← Your plans, inbox/, docs/
PACK-{domain}/              ← Your domain Knowledge
.secrets/, .mcp.json        ← Keys and Configuration
.claude/settings.local.json ← Your permissions
```

**Your rules:** add them to the "8. My rules" section at the end of CLAUDE.md (after the `<!-- USER-SPACE -->` marker). This section is preserved during updates. Rules in `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` for specific repositories are not affected at all.

**Additional modes:**
- `bash update.sh --check` — only show whether updates exist (without applying)
- `bash update.sh --yes` — apply without confirmation

**Cumulative update model:**

Changes in the Template accumulate. You can update once a day, once a week, or once a month — one `bash update.sh` command applies everything accumulated during that period. CHANGELOG.md shows what changed.

**Telegram notifications:**

Every morning at 7:28, bot @aist_me_bot sends a digest of changes from the past 24 hours (if any existed). Subscribe to the updates channel to stay informed. A notification is information. The decision to update is always yours.

**Three ways to update:**
1. Terminal: `bash update.sh`
2. AI CLI: tell your AI *"update my exocortex"*
3. Check without applying: `bash update.sh --check`

### 2.6. Optional services

The Template (L3) recommends, but does not require. Each service is configured separately:

| Service | Type | Setup | Role | Product |
|---------|------|-------|------|---------|
| WakaTime | Tool | `/setup-wakatime` | Work Observability | Metrics by project and category |
| Digital Twin | Data | Bot → `/twin` | Personalization of answers and plans | Goals, self-assessment, context |
| systemsworld.club | Ecosystem | Registration | Community, seminars | Access to materials |
| Git + GitHub | Infrastructure | `setup.sh` (auto) | Versioning, agents | Repositories, CI |
| Marp | Tool | VS Code extension + CLI | Markdown → slides | Sliduments (PDF/HTML) |
| Cloud Scheduler | Automation | `setup/optional/setup-cloud-scheduler.sh` | IWE runs 24/7 when Mac is off | Backup, health check, notifications |

**Cloud Scheduler — cloud IWE automation:** GitHub Actions workflow runs backup and health check daily at 04:00 MSK — even when Mac is off. Basic level ($0/month, no LLM). Optional: Telegram notifications with a report. Setup: `bash setup/optional/setup-cloud-scheduler.sh`. Details: `setup/optional/README.md`, Scenario [DP.SC.019](../../PACK-digital-platform/pack/digital-platform/08-service-clauses/DP.SC.019-autonomous-cloud-runtime.md).

**Health Check setup (extended):** By default, the health check monitors only the strategy repository. For multi-repository Monitoring:
1. GitHub → Settings → Variables → Actions → add `HEALTH_CHECK_REPOS` — a comma-separated list of your repositories (`owner/repo, owner/repo2`)
2. (Optional) Add `BOT_HEALTH_URL` — bot health endpoint URL for availability checks
3. (Optional) Add Secrets: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` for Telegram notifications
4. PAT (`STRATEGY_REPO_TOKEN`) must have access to all listed repositories

Manual run: `gh workflow run cloud-scheduler.yml --field task=health-check`. Report: commits (24h + 7d by repository), DayPlan, WeekPlan, backup (<48h), Sessions, bot status, WP statistics, traffic light.

**Marp — presentation preparation:** Marp converts Markdown files into slides (PDF, HTML, PPTX). Workflow: write `.md` with `---` separator → preview in VS Code (Marp extension) → export `marp --pdf slides.md`. Sliduments (MIM.WP.001) are text-based, so Markdown + Git = versions, diffs, edits through Claude Code. Setup: `npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli` + VS Code → Extensions → "Marp for VS Code".

**IntegrationGate rule:** Before adding a new tool to your IWE: (1) type, (2) Perimeter (L2/L3/L4), (3) Roles, (4) products, (5) processes.

## 3. Thinking foundation

### 3.1. Principles hierarchy

All Knowledge is organized into 4 levels. Each subsequent level is constrained by the previous one:

```
Level 0: ZP (zero principles)          ← axioms, no framework
    ↓ discipline
Level 1: FPF (first principles)        ← principles + framework (bundle)
    ↓ constrain
Level 2: SPF → Pack (second principles) ← framework + principles (separate)
    ↓ define
Level 3: S2R and others → DS           ← frameworks + principles (separate)
```

**Fallback chain:** DS (3rd) → Pack (2nd) → Base.Principles (SPF → FPF → ZP). If something is unclear at the current level — move up one level.

**Zero principles (ZP)** — 6 trans-disciplinary Constraints:

| Principle | Essence |
|-----------|---------|
| ZP.1 Axiomaticity | Build on axioms, not intuition |
| ZP.2 Structure and symmetry | Describe through invariants, not objects |
| ZP.3 Multi-scale | The model must work at different scales |
| ZP.4 Optimization | Find the extremum, do not enumerate |
| ZP.5 Probability and information | Describe uncertainty quantitatively |
| ZP.6 Computational limits | Account for finite resources |

**Where to study:**
- [ZP/hierarchy.md](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/ZP/blob/main/hierarchy.md) — map of all 4 levels
- [ZP/principles/](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/ZP/tree/main/principles) — each principle in detail
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) § 1 — type table and fallback chain

### 3.2. Hard Distinctions

30+ pairs of concepts that **must not be confused**. Confusion is the main source of errors:

| # | Pair | Essence |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | System ≠ Episteme | Physical boundaries vs. Knowledge domain |
| 2 | Method ≠ Tool | Way of working vs. instrument of work |
| 3 | Work Product ≠ Description | Observable Artifact vs. text about it |
| 4 | Accounting ≠ Planning | Recording facts vs. intentions |
| 5 | Role ≠ Agent ≠ Tool | Mask vs. who wears the mask vs. instrument |
| 6 | Method ≠ Skill | Reproducible process vs. personal ability |
| 7 | Observation ≠ Judgment | Fact vs. interpretation |
| 8-11 | Data ≠ Insight, Artifact ≠ Process, Pack ≠ Governance, Process ≠ Service ≠ Scenario | Ontological |
| 12-22 | Description ≠ Knowledge, DDD strategic ≠ tactical, Platform ≠ Template ≠ Personal IWE, ... | Methodological and operational |
| 25-26 | Draft ≠ Prepared piece, Prepared piece ≠ Post | Stages of the creative Pipeline |
| 27 | Bot ≠ Platform; Neon = one Digital Twin | Digital Twin Architecture |
| 28 | Prosthesis ≠ Exoskeleton | AI–human interaction pattern (§ 1.1a) |
| 29 | Pack knowledge ≠ Implementation decision | Domain truth → Pack. Technical choice → DS |
| 32 | Three Verification classes | closed-loop / open-loop / problem-framing (§ 5.1b) |
| 36 | Exocortex ≠ IWE | Exocortex is the description storage Subsystem within IWE |

### 3.3. FPF First Principles

FPF (First Principles Framework) — "the operating system for thinking." Defines the basic constructs and rules for combining them.

| Part | Content | When to read |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A | Core: Holon, BoundedContext, Role-Method-Work | Basic Distinctions |
| B | Aggregation, Trust, Evolution cycles | Understanding processes |
| C | Domain extensions (CAL) | Custom calculi |
| D | Ethics and conflict optimization | Multi-scale decisions |
| E | Constitution and authorship | Framework governance |
| F | Terminology: UTS, Bridges | Cross-domain alignment |
| G | SoTA Kit | Knowledge work patterns |

**How to read:** NOT sequentially. Start with the table of contents, then navigate to needed sections by searching for codes (for example `FPF A.7` = Strict Distinction).

**Where to study:**

## 4. Repositories and projects

### 4.1. Three repository types

Every repository belongs to one of 3 types. The type determines who creates it and what it stores:

| Type | Subtype | What it stores | Source-of-truth? | Examples |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Base** | Principles | ZP, FPF, SPF — principles and frameworks | Yes | ZP, FPF, SPF |
| **Base** | Formats | FMT-* — structure Protocols | Yes (for the format) | FMT-exocortex-template, FMT-s2r |
| **Pack** | — | Domain passport | Yes | PACK-{domain} |
| **DS** | instrument / governance / surface | Derived from Pack | No | DS-strategy, DS-ai-systems |

**Key point:** **Base = Platform provides** (principles, frameworks, Templates). **Pack and DS = user creates.** Pack is the **sole** source-of-truth for domain Knowledge. DS consumes — it does not create.

**Where to study:**
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) § 1 — full table, fallback chain
- [memory/repo-type-rules.md](../memory/repo-type-rules.md) — rules for each type

### 4.2. DS: three subtypes

DS is the most common repository type you will create:

| Subtype | What it stores | Examples | When to create |
|---------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| **governance** | Plans, strategy, coordination | DS-strategy, DS-ecosystem-development (local) | During setup (DS-strategy — automatically) |
| **instrument** | Code, bots, agents, MCP | DS-ai-systems, DS-aist-bot | When building a system based on Pack |
| **surface** | Courses, guides, posts, content | DS-Knowledge-Index, DS-blog | When creating educational content |

### 4.3. Base/Formats — standard Templates

The Platform provides standard formats (Base/Formats) — repository structure Protocols:

| Format | Purpose | For whom |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **FMT-exocortex-template** | Personal workspace (IWE) | Every T4+ user |
| **FMT-s2r** | Project repositories: 3×3 matrix (systems × Roles) | Advanced users with multi-component projects |

**FMT-s2r (System-to-Role)** organizes a project by kernels, each of which is described through 9 documents (3 systems × 3 Roles). Useful when a project has multiple systems: mobile app + backend + Infrastructure.

> **Your own formats:** A user can create their own format — this will be a DS repository with `template: true` in REPO-TYPE.md.

**Where to study:**
- [FMT-s2r/README.md](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-s2r) — overview and structure

### 4.4. Creating and managing DS projects

**When to create:**

| Situation | What to create | How |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Defined a Knowledge Domain | `PACK-{domain}` | `/pack-new` — guided flow through SPF (verifies/clones SPF+FPF, asks for Domain, creates scaffold) |
| Building a system (bot, tool) | `DS-{project}` (instrument) | `gh repo create DS-my-tool --private` |
| Creating a course or content | `DS-{project}` (surface) | `gh repo create DS-my-course --private` |
| Coordinating multiple systems | `DS-{hub}` (governance) | `gh repo create DS-my-hub --private` |

**What every DS-* must contain:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — rules for Claude Code (specific to this repository)
- `inbox/WP-*.md` — contexts for active Work Products (single source — aggregated by `scripts/active-wp-sweep.sh`)
- `MAPSTRATEGIC.md` — where THIS system is heading

**MAPSTRATEGIC.md vs Strategy.md:**

| | MAPSTRATEGIC.md | Strategy.md |
|---|----------------|-------------|
| **Where** | In each system repository | `DS-strategy/docs/` |
| **Who writes** | System owner | Strategist (aggregation) |
| **What** | "Where THIS system is heading" | "Where I am heading" |

**Flow:** MAPSTRATEGIC (each repository) → Strategist (session-prep) → Strategy.md → WeekPlan

### 4.5. Naming and coding

**Repository prefixes:**

| Prefix | Type | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| `ZP`, `FPF`, `SPF` | Base/Principles | ZP, FPF, SPF |
| `FMT-` | Base/Formats | FMT-exocortex-template |
| `PACK-` | Pack | PACK-digital-platform |
| `DS-` | DS | DS-ai-systems, DS-strategy |

**Pack entity coding:** `CONTEXT.TYPE.NNN`

| Part | What | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Context | Pack abbreviation | DP (digital-platform), MIM, PD |
| Type | Entity kind | M (method), WP (work product), D (distinction), FM (failure mode) |
| Number | Unique sequential number | 001, 002, ... |

**Examples:** `DP.M.001` (method), `MIM.FM.003` (failure mode), `DP.ROLE.001` (agent)

**Where to study:**
- [SPF/spec/SPF.SPEC.001-entity-coding.md](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/SPF/blob/main/spec/SPF.SPEC.001-entity-coding.md) — full specification

## 5. Daily work

### 5.1. OWC fractal: Day and Session

OWC (Opening → Work → Closing) is a **fractal pattern** that operates at two scales. A Day consists of Sessions; each Session is a complete OWC cycle within the daily cycle.

```
Day
├── Day Open   — morning ritual: yesterday → plan → self-development → world
│   ├── Session 1: Open → Work → Close
│   ├── Session 2: Open → Work → Close
│   └── ...
└── Day Close  — evening ritual: results → acknowledgment → tomorrow's setup

Session
├── Session Open  — WP Gate → Alignment Ritual
├── Session Work  — Capture-to-Pack + milestone checks
└── Session Close — KE → statuses → backup → report
```

**Skipping Open** = unplanned work. **Skipping Close** = unrecorded result.

| Scale | Stage | Trigger | Role |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| **Day** | Opening | "open day" | R1 Strategist |
| **Day** | Work | Between Day Open and Day Close | R1 + R6 |
| **Day** | Closing | "close day" / "day results" | R1 Strategist |
| **Session** | Opening | Any assignment (without exception) | R6 Coder |
| **Session** | Work | After passing Opening | R6 Coder |
| **Session** | Closing | "closing" / "done" / "close" | R6 Coder |

> **Distinction: Day ≠ Session.** Day Open/Close are separate ritual Sessions (trigger only, no assignment). Session Open/Close always exist in the context of specific work.

#### Day Open (morning ritual)

The Strategist (R1) executes 7 steps:

1. **Yesterday** — commits from yesterday across all repositories → 1-3 key results
2. **Today's plan** — full carry-over from Day Close + 2-4 focused Work Products from WeekPlan (≥1h). **Slot 1 = self-development** (mandatory)
3. **Self-development** — current guide, where you stopped, active drafts
4. **Strategizing** — if today is `strategy_day` (from `day-rhythm-config.yaml`) → **do NOT create DayPlan** (the day's plan is already in WeekPlan → section "Plan for Monday"). Show WeekPlan, skip step 7
4b. **Pomodoros** — show current settings (work/break/long break), offer to adjust
5. **IWE overnight** — automation logs (sync-agent, note-review, reindex) — did they run?
6. **World** — digest on configured topics (RSS / WebSearch)
7. **Record** — create/update `DayPlan YYYY-MM-DD.md` in DS-strategy/current/. **Skipped on strategy_day** (step 4)

**Product:** DayPlan (on regular days) or WeekPlan (on strategy_day) — handoff Artifact from Strategist to human.

#### Day Close (evening ritual)

The Strategist (R1) gathers the day's results:

1. **Review** — "Work Product × status" table (done / partial / not started)
2. **What was learned** — captures in Pack, Distinctions, insights, guidance
3. **Acknowledgment** — what worked, what was difficult
4. **Nothing forgotten?** — uncommitted changes, branch synchronization, commitments
5. **Tomorrow's setup** — where to start, what context to prepare (Agent→Agent handoff)
6. **Record** — add "Day results" to DayPlan, update statuses in WeekPlan + MEMORY.md

#### Day Work (daily rules)

| # | Rule | Essence |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | Slot 1 = self-development | Do not move to routine work until the slot is completed |
| 2 | Sessions = OWC | Every Session is a complete Open → Work → Close cycle |
| 3 | Pomodoros | 25/5, long break after 4 cycles |
| 4 | Reminder | Session > 50 min without a break → reminder |
| 5 | Check against plan | Between Sessions: "Am I still on the day plan?" |

### 5.1b. Session Open: WP Gate + Ritual

#### WP Gate (blocking)

**First action for ANY assignment:** check whether the task is in the plan.

1. Read MEMORY.md → section "Work Products of the current week"
2. Matches → proceed + **DayPlan Gate:** if the Work Product is not in today's DayPlan → add a line
3. Does not match → STOP → record the Work Product in 4 places (MEMORY.md, WP-REGISTRY, WeekPlan, WP context file) → only then begin

**Exceptions:** tasks ≤15 min, questions without changes, emergency bug fixes. But if an exception grows into real work → *"This is turning into a Work Product. Record it?"*

#### Alignment Ritual

Before work, Claude announces:

> **User's Role:** [one of 4 Roles]
> **Claude's Role:** [from catalog]
> **Work:** [what]
> **Work Product:** [Artifact]
> **Verification class:** [trivial / closed-loop / open-loop / problem-framing]
> **Method:** [how]
> **Estimate:** ~Xh
> **Model:** [current] — I recommend [model] ([reason])

**4 user Roles** (Tseren in their own IWE):
1. Platform developer → Pack, DS-ecosystem, FMT
2. Platform user → bot, LMS, courses
3. Developer of their own IWE → exocortex, CLAUDE.md, Protocols (ABOVE the system)
4. User of their own IWE → plans, reviews, posts, captures (WITHIN the system)

**Verification class** (determines the work mode):

| Class | Verification | Mode | Model recommendation |
|-------|-------------|------|---------------------|
| **trivial** | Not needed (result is obvious) | Agent autonomous, no captures | Haiku |
| **closed-loop** | Cheap, automated (tests) | Agent autonomous | Sonnet |
| **open-loop** | Expensive, deferred | Collaborative, captures mandatory | Opus |
| **problem-framing** | Unknown | Exoskeletal: questions > answers | Opus |

> **Model switching — two Scenarios:**
> - **Entire Session on a different model:** If at opening Claude determines the task is trivial/closed-loop and the current model is excessive, it will say: *"This task is trivial, I recommend switching to Haiku via `/model`. I cannot switch automatically."* The user switches manually → the entire Session runs on the cheaper model.
> - **Separate task within a Session:** A trivial task appears mid-Session → Claude delegates to a sub-agent on a cheaper model. The Session is not interrupted. Delegation is only downward: Opus→Sonnet/Haiku, Sonnet→Haiku. Switching upward requires `/model`.

**Exoskeletal mode** (only for problem-framing): Claude does NOT propose a solution immediately. First, 3 clarifying questions (What? Why? Constraints?) → answers → 2-3 approach options with trade-offs → user selects → work begins.

**Session registration:** after alignment → a line in `<governance-repo>/inbox/open-sessions.log`.

### 5.1c. Session Close: full checklist

- [ ] Pull → `cd DS-strategy && git pull --rebase`
- [ ] Knowledge Extraction (R2): collect captures → Extraction Report → approval
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md (Work Product statuses)
- [ ] Update WP-REGISTRY.md (statuses + new Work Products)
- [ ] Git commit + push
- [ ] Update WeekPlan (Work Product statuses)
- [ ] Update DayPlan (statuses of ALL lines: Work Products + ad-hoc)
- [ ] Backup: memory/ + CLAUDE.md → DS-strategy/exocortex/
- [ ] WP Context File: update (in_progress) or archive (done → archive/wp-contexts/)
- [ ] Selective Reindex: Pack changed? → `selective-reindex.sh`
- [ ] Repo CLAUDE.md: feat-commits → new rules?
- [ ] Draft-list: Pack enriched → suggest a draft?
- [ ] Template CHANGELOG: commits to FMT-exocortex-template? → update
- [ ] Session log: remove line from open-sessions.log
- [ ] Close report: what was done, what remains

#### Exit Protocol (for all Roles)

| # | Step | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| 1 | **Artifact** | Without an Artifact — work does not exist |
| 2 | **Status** | Without a status — Progress is invisible |
| 3 | **Notification** | Without a notification — the chain breaks |

**Where to study:**

### 5.2. Three-layer memory

| Layer | File | What it contains | Limit | When read |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | `MEMORY.md` | Week tasks, lessons, navigation | ≤100 lines | Every Session (auto) |
| 2 | `CLAUDE.md` | Slim core: Blocking rules + navigation | ~90 lines | At start (auto) |
| 3 | `memory/*.md` | Protocols, Distinctions, SOTA, Roles, checklists | ≤11 files | By triggers from CLAUDE.md |
| 4 | `.claude/skills/` | Templates, rituals (lazy loading) | On demand | Only on `/skill` command |

**memory/ files:**

| File | Topic | When to read |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `protocol-open.md` | Opening Protocol | Every Session (auto) |
| `protocol-work.md` | Work Protocol | After opening |
| `protocol-close.md` | Closing Protocol | On completion |
| `navigation.md` | Repository navigation | Finding files |
| `hard-distinctions.md` | 30+ Distinctions | When confused about terms |
| `fpf-reference.md` | FPF navigation | When creating/reviewing Pack |
| `sota-reference.md` | SOTA Practices | For architectural decisions |
| `checklists.md` | Quality checklists | Before responding, before modifying |
| `repo-type-rules.md` | Repository type rules | When working with a specific type |
| `roles.md` | Role catalog (AI + human) | During the Session opening ritual |

> **`roles.md` — an evolving file.** The Template provides Platform Roles (R1–R21). Add your own Roles to the "User roles" section (R100+). This helps Claude select precise behavior for each task — not guessing, but consulting the table.

**Policy:** Maximum 11 files. Reference files ≤100 lines, Protocols ≤150, registries ≤200 + cleanup on Close. Cross-system content → memory/. System-specific content → `<repo>/CLAUDE.md`.

### 5.3. Capture-to-Pack: capturing Knowledge

At every Work milestone (subtask completed, pattern found, decision made), ask: **is there Knowledge to record? Is there a seed for a post?**

| Knowledge type | Where | When | Who writes |
|---------------|-------|------|-----------|
| Rule for all repositories (1-3 lines) | `~/IWE/CLAUDE.md` | Immediately | Claude |
| Rule for one repository | `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` | Immediately | Claude |
| Domain (Architecture, patterns) | Corresponding Pack | On Close | R2 Extractor → Pack |
| Distinction, method, FM, WP | Corresponding Pack | On Close | R2 Extractor → Pack |
| Implementation (Protocols, processes, configs) | DS docs/, PROCESSES.md, protocol-*.md | Immediately/Close | Claude / R2 |
| Seed for a post | `DS-strategy/drafts/draft-list.md` + `drafts/` | On Close | Claude |
| Major lesson | `memory/<topic>.md` | Immediately | Claude |

> **Dual KE routing (HD #29):** Pack knowledge ≠ Implementation decision. The Extractor (R2) on Close proposes recording Knowledge in two places: domain → Pack, implementation → DS docs/. One Pipeline, two outputs.

**Announcement format:** *"Capture: [what] → [where]"*

### 5.4. CLAUDE.md: structure and customization

The system uses two levels of CLAUDE.md:

| Level | File | Scope | Who updates |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Root** | `~/IWE/CLAUDE.md` | All repositories in the workspace | Platform (update.sh) + you (lessons) |
| **Repository** | `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` | Only this repository | You (rules for this specific repository) |

**When to use which:**
- Rule applies to all projects → root CLAUDE.md
- Rule is specific to one repository → `<repo>/CLAUDE.md`
- Example: "Always pull before commit in DS-strategy" → root. "Commit format in DS-aist-bot: feat/fix/chore" → repository.

**When you create a new DS-* repository**, add a CLAUDE.md to it containing:
- Repository type (downstream/instrument)
- Related Pack (source of Knowledge)
- Specific rules (commit format, tests, Deployment)

### 5.5. Strategist: automatic planning

The Strategist is Role R1, executed by Claude Code on a schedule (launchd on macOS, cron on Linux) or by trigger:

| Scenario | When | What it does | Product |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Day Open** | Morning (trigger "open day") | 7 steps: yesterday → plan → self-development → pomodoros → IWE overnight → world → record | DayPlan |
| **Day Close** | Evening (trigger "close day") | Results → what was learned → acknowledgment → tomorrow's setup | Updated DayPlan |
| **Session-Prep** | Monday morning (auto) | Analysis of last week + MAPSTRATEGIC | Draft WeekPlan |
| **Strategy-Session** | After session-prep | Interactive plan discussion | Approved WeekPlan |
| **Week-Review** | Sunday evening (auto) | WakaTime metrics, achievements, lessons | "W{N} Results" section in WeekPlan |
| **Note-Review** | As needed | Processing fleeting notes and captures | Routing to Pack/inbox |
| **Add-WP** | For a new task | Adding a Work Product to the plan (4 places) | Updated WeekPlan + WP file |

**DS-strategy — strategy hub:**

| Folder | What it contains |
|--------|----------------|
| `current/` | Current WeekPlan, DayPlan |
| `inbox/WP-*.md` | Task contexts (live work history) |
| `docs/Strategy.md` | Your overall strategy |
| `docs/Dissatisfactions.md` | Dissatisfactions (change triggers) |
| `drafts/` | Personal drafts + draft-list.md (index, ≤7 days TTL) |
| `archive/` | Completed plans |
| `exocortex/` | Backup of memory/ + CLAUDE.md |

**Single-source pattern:** DS-strategy (hub) — sole registry (`WP-REGISTRY.md` + `inbox/WP-*.md`), aggregated by `scripts/active-wp-sweep.sh`. Hub-and-spoke with WORKPLAN.md was cancelled by WP-283 Ф-H (May 2026).

#### Configuring the strategy day

By default, the strategy Session launches on **Sunday** (`strategy_day: sunday` in `memory/day-rhythm-config.yaml`). You can choose any day of the week:

```yaml
# memory/day-rhythm-config.yaml
day_open:
  strategy_day: saturday   # sunday..sunday — your strategy day
```

On this day:
- `strategist.sh` runs `session-prep` instead of `day-plan`
- `scheduler.sh` runs `week-review`
- **Day Open does not create a DayPlan** — the day's plan is embedded in WeekPlan (section "Plan for [day]")
- All three components read `strategy_day` from the config — no hardcoded values are used

#### Activation Gate: how pending Work Products enter the plan

Every Work Product in ⏳ pending status has an **activation condition** — the answer to "under what condition does this Work Product enter the WeekPlan?"

| Condition type | Example | How it is checked |
|---------------|---------|------------------|
| **date** | `W15`, `after Apr 1` | Strategist on Session-Prep: `date ≤ current week?` |
| **dep** | `dep: WP-73` | On Close of the dependency: `WP-73 = done → alert` |
| **on-demand** | `when budget is available` | Only manually during strategizing |

**Dormant Review:** `on-demand` older than 3 weeks → automatically added to the Strategy Session agenda. Question: "Archive (📦) or assign a specific condition?" This prevents accumulation of "dead" Work Products.

Conditions are stored in the "Activation" column in [WP-REGISTRY](../seed/strategy/docs/WP-REGISTRY.md).

**Where to study:**
- [roles/strategist/prompts/](../roles/strategist/prompts/) — 9 prompts for each Scenario

### 5.6. Creative Pipeline: from note to post

> Formalization: [PD.FORM.005 Creative Pipeline](https://github.com/aisystant/PACK-personal/blob/main/pack/personal-development/02-domain-entities/formalizations/PD.FORM.005-creative-pipeline.md)

The creative Pipeline is a closed process that transforms thoughts into published texts and formalized Knowledge. Key invariant: **nothing accumulates** — every Artifact must progress or be closed within its TTL.

#### 4 Artifact stages

```
Note (≤7d) → Draft (≤7d) → Prepared piece (≤14d) → Post
fleeting-notes   DS-strategy/      Knowledge Index       Published
inbox/           drafts/            status: draft          status: published
```

| Stage | Where stored | TTL | Visibility |
|-------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| **Note** | `DS-strategy/inbox/fleeting-notes.md` | ≤7 days | Personal |
| **Draft** | `DS-strategy/drafts/*.md` | ≤7 days | Personal |
| **Prepared piece** | `DS-Knowledge-Index/docs/` (status: draft) | ≤14 days | Public |
| **Post** | `DS-Knowledge-Index/docs/` (status: published) | — | Public |

#### 7 note directions

Note-Review classifies each note into one direction. A draft is only a recommendation — it is created after confirmation.

| # | Category | Criterion | Where |
|---|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **NEP** | Dissatisfaction, discomfort, "I want to change this" | `Dissatisfactions.md` |
| 2 | **Task** | Specific action, "do tomorrow" | WeekPlan / DayPlan |
| 3 | **Knowledge** | Pattern, Distinction, Method, rule, insight | `captures.md` → Pack |
| 4 | **Draft** | Seed for a post, reflection with concepts | Recommendation → `drafts/` (after confirmation) |
| 5 | **Idea** 🔄 | Reflection, no specific action | Stays in notes (revisit during strategizing) |
| 6 | **Personal data** | Contact, account, token, credentials | `personal/*.md` |
| 7 | **Noise** | Test, duplicate, already done, link without context | ~~strikethrough~~ → archive |

#### Two key Distinctions

1. **Draft ≠ Prepared piece.** A draft is personal text (`DS-strategy/drafts/`), can be raw. A prepared piece is public text (`DS-Knowledge-Index/`, status: draft), must be coherent. *Test:* can you show it to someone else? No → draft.

2. **Prepared piece ≠ Post.** A prepared piece is published but not promoted. A post is actively promoted. *Test:* ready to attract attention? No → prepared piece.

#### Anti-accumulation: TTL and guards

Every Artifact MUST exit into one of the directions within its TTL. When drafts accumulate, guards activate:

| Threshold | Response | What to do |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| ≤5 drafts | Normal | Work by Priority |
| 6-10 drafts | **Warning** | Prioritize or close extras down to ≤5 |
| >10 drafts | **Blocking** | Cannot add new ones. First advance or close down to ≤5 |

Guards are checked at every Note-Review and when creating a new draft.

#### Closed loop: Pack ↔ Content

The Pipeline does not operate linearly — it operates as a **closed loop**:

1. **Feedback from posts** — reader reactions → new notes → new cycle.
2. **Pack → Content** — when the Extractor adds ≥3 entities on one topic to Pack → a draft for a post is automatically suggested (popularizing formalized Knowledge).

#### Pipeline health test (at every strategy Session)

1. Inputs ≈ outputs? (N notes created → ~N sorted)
2. TTL not violated? (notes >7d? drafts >7d? prepared pieces >14d?)
3. Guard not violated? (drafts ≤5?)
4. Pack → post? (there were captures → draft suggested?)

If ≥2 answers are "no" → the Pipeline has stalled → raise as a question during strategizing.

#### IWE materialization

| Component | File |
|-----------|------|
| Draft index | `DS-strategy/drafts/draft-list.md` |
| Drafts | `DS-strategy/drafts/*.md` |
| Sorting Protocol | `roles/strategist/prompts/note-review.md` (category #4) |
| Close Protocol | `memory/protocol-close.md` (step 9: draft-list) |

## 6. Knowledge: Pack and extraction

### 6.1. What is Pack

Pack is a formalized domain passport. The **sole source-of-truth** for domain Knowledge.

**Contains:**
- Bounded Context (domain boundaries)
- Distinctions (what must not be confused)
- Ontology (entities and relationships)
- Roles (who acts)
- Methods (how to act)
- Work Products (Method results)
- Failure Modes (typical errors)
- SOTA annotations (Knowledge currency)

**Live example:** [PACK-digital-platform](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/PACK-digital-platform) (40+ entities)

### 6.2. Creating a Pack (11 SPF stages)

SPF defines the Pack creation process:

| # | Stage | Essence |
|---|-------|---------|
| 01 | Domain selection | Define and constrain the domain |
| 02 | Bounded Context | Establish semantic boundaries |
| 03 | Working with Distinctions | Which pairs must not be confused |
| 04 | Entity identification | Roles, objects, Constraints |
| 05 | Information intake | Input materials for analysis |
| 06 | Analysis and formalization | Formalization through Distinctions |
| 07 | Method and Work Product extraction | Methods → Work Products |
| 08 | Failure mode extraction | Typical interpretation errors |
| 09 | SOTA annotations | current / hypothesis / deprecated |
| 10 | Map maintenance | Graph of relationships between entities |
| 11 | Review and evolution cycle | Continuous update Protocol |

**Quick start:** `/pack-new` — the Skill will guide you through domain selection, Pack name, scaffold creation, and will show the Roadmap Ф1-Ф6.

### 6.4. Knowledge Extractor (R2)

**Role:** Transforms information into formalized Pack entities.

**Pipeline:** `classify → route → formalize → validate`

| Scenario | Trigger | When you see the result |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Session-Close | Close Protocol | When closing a Session, Claude will suggest new Pack entities |
| On-Demand | Your command | Immediately in Claude Code |
| Bulk-Extraction | Document processing | After analysis — Extraction Report |
| Inbox-Check | Schedule | In DayPlan (if there is something new) |

**Key rule:** The Extractor always **proposes** — it never writes without approval.

**How this works for you:**
1. You work in Claude Code → captures appear during the Session
2. On Close → Claude activates the Extractor Role (R2) and shows the Extraction Report
3. You approve → entities are written to Pack

**Where to study:**
- Close Protocol (§ 5.1) — when the Extractor is activated
- [DP.ROLE.001](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/PACK-digital-platform/blob/main/pack/digital-platform/02-domain-entities/DP.ROLE.001-platform-roles.md) R2 — full Role description

### 6.5. Knowledge MCP servers

Claude Code connects to the Platform's Gateway MCP server (via https://claude.ai/settings/connectors). Gateway `iwe-knowledge` (`mcp.aisystant.com/mcp`) aggregates all backends — one connection point for all knowledge tools.

#### knowledge — Knowledge base search

Hybrid search (vector + keyword) across all Pack repositories and documentation. ~5400 documents.

| Tool | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `knowledge_search` | Semantic + keyword search | `knowledge_search("service tiers", source_type="pack")` → DP.ARCH.002 |
| `knowledge_get_document` | Specific document by name | `knowledge_get_document("DP.ROLE.001-platform-roles.md")` |
| `knowledge_list_sources` | List all sources | Shows document count by category |

**Source types:** `pack` (domain Knowledge), `guides` (guides), `ds` (processes).

> Search through guides: `knowledge_search("query", source_type="guides")`. A separate guides server is not needed — the Gateway unifies all sources.

#### digital-twin — learner's Digital Twin

Learner data metamodel: goals, self-assessment, context, Progress.

| Tool | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `dt_describe_by_path` | Metamodel structure | `dt_describe_by_path("/")` → 4 categories IND.1-4 |
| `dt_read_digital_twin` | Read data | `dt_read_digital_twin("1_declarative/1_2_goals")` → learner's goals |
| `dt_write_digital_twin` | Write to IND.1 | `dt_write_digital_twin("1_declarative/...", data)` |

> **IND.1 (Declarative)** is the only writable category. IND.2 (Collected), IND.3 (Derived), IND.4 (Generated) — read-only.

#### When to use which tool

| Situation | Gateway tool |
|-----------|-------------|
| Domain question, pattern, Architecture | `knowledge_search(query, source_type="pack")` |
| Specific document by code (DP.ROLE.001) | `knowledge_get_document("filename")` |
| Learning, methodology, guides | `knowledge_search(query, source_type="guides")` |
| Learner goals, self-assessment | `dt_read_digital_twin("path")` |
| Before writing to Pack — duplicate check | `knowledge_search` + `knowledge_get_document` |

### 6.6. Ontology: Knowledge graph

The Ontology is a graph of concepts and relationships. Each level has its own:

| Level | Where | What |
|-------|-------|------|
| SPF-level | `SPF/ontology.md` | Universal framework concepts |
| Pack-level | `PACK-{}/01-domain-contract/01C-ontology.md` | Entities of a specific Pack |
| Ecosystem | `DS-ecosystem-development/ontology.md` (local repository) | 31 concepts: Platform + ecosystem |
| Personal | `DS-strategy/ontology.md` | Personal development + cross-links |

**Principle:** SPF inherits FPF → Pack extends SPF → Downstream references Pack.

**Where to study:**
- [SPF/ontology.md](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/SPF/blob/main/ontology.md) — SPF-level
- [SPF/docs/conceptual-model.md](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/SPF/blob/main/docs/conceptual-model.md) — conceptual map

## 7. Roles and AI agents

### 7.1. Role-centric approach (DP.D.033)

In IWE, a Role is described **independently of the performer**. First: what to do, what obligations, what Work Products. Then: who performs.

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|----------|
| **Role** | Function: WHAT to do (obligations, Work Products, Methods) |
| **Performer (holder)** | System: WHO does it (Claude, bash, human) |
| **Agent** | Performer with autonomy (Grade 2+) |
| **Tool** | Performer without autonomy (Grade 0-1) |

**Key principles:**
- **Role ≠ System.** One name can refer to both a Role and a system — these are different perspectives
- **One performer — many Roles.** Claude plays the Roles of Strategist, Extractor, and Coder
- **One Role — many performers.** Role of Synchronizer: bash (mechanics) + Claude (Audit)

**Notation:** `Holder#Role:Context@Window` (FPF A.2)

### 7.2. Agent catalog

#### At your level (L4 Personal IWE)

These agents work in your Claude Code, on your machine:

| Agent | Role | What it does | When you see the result |
|-------|------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Strategist (R1)** | Planning | Day Open/Close, WeekPlan, DayPlan, strategy Sessions | Morning (launchd → Telegram), Session (Claude Code) |
| **Extractor (R2)** | Knowledge formalization | Captures → Pack entities (dual routing: Pack + DS) | Session Close in Claude Code |

#### On the Platform (L2 Platform)

These agents run on Platform Infrastructure. You only see the results:

| Agent | Role | What it does | How you see the result |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Synchronizer (R8)** | Coordination | Fleeting-notes sync, notifications | Telegram notifications |
| **Templateer (R9)** | Template updating | Drift detection, validation | During `update.sh` |
| **Statistician (R10)** | Analytics | DAU/WAU/MAU, retention | `/analytics` in bot |
| **Fixer (R11)** | Error correction | Auto-fix, restart, escalate | GitHub Issues, Telegram notifications |

> **For T4 users:** R1 (Strategist) and R2 (Extractor) are the primary agents. Platform agents (R8-R11) run in the background.

### 7.3. Agent interaction diagram

```
Schedule / User action
    ↓
R8 Synchronizer (dispatcher)
    ├─→ R1 Strategist (plans, reviews)
    │   └─→ DS-strategy/current/Plan, Day, Report
    ├─→ R2 Extractor (knowledge)
    │   └─→ Pack entities, DS-strategy/inbox/
    ├─→ R9 Templateer (updates)
    │   └─→ FMT-exocortex-template/
    ├─→ R11 Fixer (bot errors)
    │   └─→ GitHub PR, Issues
    ├─→ R10 Statistician (analytics)
    │   └─→ Telegram report, /analytics
    └─→ Telegram notifications
```

**Where to study:**
- Role catalog (21 Roles R1-R21): [DP.ROLE.001](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/PACK-digital-platform/blob/main/pack/digital-platform/02-domain-entities/DP.ROLE.001-platform-roles.md)
- Architectural justification: [DP.D.033](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/PACK-digital-platform/blob/main/pack/digital-platform/01-domain-contract/DP.D.033-role-centric-architecture.md)

### 7.4. Role contract (for developers)

Every Role in `roles/` follows a formal contract — a specification of what the Role directory must contain. The contract enables auto-discovery: `setup.sh` and `update.sh` automatically find and process Roles without hardcoded lists.

**Minimum required files:**
- `role.yaml` — machine-readable Manifest (name, type, installation mode)
- `README.md` — human-readable description
- `install.sh` — installation entry point

**Details and role.yaml schema:** [roles/ROLE-CONTRACT.md](../roles/ROLE-CONTRACT.md)

## 8. Quality and architectural decisions

### 8.1. ArchGate (EMOSSS)

**Blocking rule:** Any architectural decision is evaluated against 7 characteristics. Threshold ≥8.

| Characteristic | Question |
|----------------|---------|
| **E**volvability | What will break when this changes? |
| **M**anageability at scale | What happens at 10x? |
| **O**nboardability | How long to read before starting? Exoskeleton or prosthesis? |
| **S**eed generativity | Does it create a Platform for new things? |
| **S**peed | What is the latency? (bot <3 sec, CLI <1 sec) |
| **S**OTA alignment | How do the best solve this? Check SOTA. |
| **S**ecurity | What are the threats? PII, secrets, injection surface? |

**Format:** Decision → principles (step 1) → evaluation table (step 2) → what is weak → how to strengthen (step 3).

**Coordination cost check** (for multi-agent solutions): is coordination cost < parallelism gain? Three conditions: (1) context isolation, (2) parallelism gain, (3) tool specialization. All three NOT met → single-agent.

### 8.2. SOTA Practices

Priority trio (check ALWAYS for architectural decisions):

| # | Practice | Essence |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Context Engineering | Write/Select/Compress/Isolate — what enters the agent's context |
| 2 | DDD Strategic | BC = Pack scope, UL = ontology, Context Map = typed `related:` |
| 3 | Coupling Model | Relationships across 3 dimensions: knowledge, distance, volatility |

Full list: Platform + Pack-architectural Practices.

**Where to study:**
- [memory/sota-reference.md](../memory/sota-reference.md) — all 18 with descriptions
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) § 5 — currency checklist

### 8.3. Quality checklists

| Checklist | When |
|-----------|------|
| Before responding | At least 1 file loaded, repository type known |
| Before modifying | CLAUDE.md read, source-of-truth not broken |
| When recording a process | Pack + PROCESSES.md + CLAUDE.md (all three) |
| Before proposing a fix | ArchGate applied, root cause fixed |

**Where to study:**
- [memory/checklists.md](../memory/checklists.md) — all checklists

### 8.4. IntegrationGate

**Before adding a new tool, agent, or system — STOP.** Answer 5 questions:

1. **Type:** tool (Grade 0-1) or agent (Grade 2+)?
2. **Perimeter:** L2 Platform / L3 Template / L4 Personal?
3. **Roles:** which Roles does it perform?
4. **Products:** what does it create and for whom?
5. **Processes:** which Method descriptions are affected?

No answers → do NOT start. Define the level → describe → then implement.

### 8.5. Security in IWE

IWE works with personal data: strategy, plans, goals, Digital Twin. Security is an architectural characteristic (EMOSSS), not an add-on.

#### Security model: 3 zones

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Zone 1: LOCAL (your computer)                     │
│  CLAUDE.md, memory/, DS-strategy/ (local copy)     │
│  → Protection: OS-level (FileVault, password)      │
└───────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                        │ git push (you control)
┌───────────────────────▼────────────────────────────┐
│  Zone 2: PRIVATE REPOS (your GitHub)               │
│  DS-strategy/, PACK-*/, DS-*/ (private repos)      │
│  → Protection: GitHub access control + SSH/OAuth   │
└───────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                        │ API calls (authorized)
┌───────────────────────▼────────────────────────────┐
│  Zone 3: PLATFORM (IWE services)                   │
│  Bot, Claude API, Digital Twin                     │
│  → Protection: per-user OAuth, tokens, isolation   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### IWE security principles

| Principle | Meaning | How it is implemented |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| **Secrets out of git** | API keys and tokens do not end up in Repositories | `~/.config/`, `~/.wakatime/`, env vars |
| **Per-user blast radius** | Compromising one user does not affect others | Per-user OAuth 2.0, isolated data |
| **Personal data isolated** | Your plans and strategy belong only to you | Private repositories, local memory/ |
| **Platform-space ≠ User-space** | Methodology (shared) is separated from data (personal) | Standard vs Personal zones |
| **CLI permission whitelist** | Claude Code only executes allowed commands | `.claude/settings.local.json` with explicit allowlist |

#### What Claude sees (and does not see)

| Claude sees | Claude does NOT see |
|-------------|---------------------|
| CLAUDE.md, memory/*.md (your instructions) | Passwords, SSH keys, API tokens |
| Files in open Sessions (while you are working) | Files of other users |
| Current conversation context | History of past conversations (reset at new Session) |
| Contents of repositories you have granted access to | Repositories outside the working directory |

> **Anthropic API:** Anthropic [does not use API data](https://www.anthropic.com/policies/privacy-policy) to train models. Data is processed but not stored for training.

#### What the user should do

1. **DS-strategy/ — private.** Confirm at creation: `gh repo create DS-strategy --private`
2. **Do not commit `.env` files.** If working with API keys — add to `.gitignore`
3. **Use SSH for git.** `gh auth login` → SSH → more secure than passwords
4. **FileVault (macOS) / LUKS (Linux).** Disk Encryption protects the local zone
5. **Token rotation.** If compromised — `gh auth refresh`, change keys in `~/.config/`

#### AI system security (AI-specific threats)

IWE uses an LLM (Claude) — this creates a specific class of threats:

| Threat | Description | How IWE protects |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Prompt injection** | Malicious instruction embedded in data | CLAUDE.md — explicit allowlist, ArchGate checks injection surface |
| **Context leakage** | Data from one Session reaches another | Each Claude Code Session is a new context. Memory contains only what you recorded |
| **Over-reliance on AI** | AI suggests, but can be wrong | Protocols require confirmation: WP Gate, ArchGate, Capture |

**Where to study:**
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) § 5 — EMOSSS (including the Security characteristic)
- [DP.ARCH.001 § 4.7](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/PACK-digital-platform/blob/main/pack/digital-platform/02-domain-entities/DP.ARCH.001-platform-architecture.md) — architectural Security characteristic

## 9. Platform: bot and tiers

### 9.1. 4-axis tier model

**T axis (learner):**

| Tier | Name | Entry | AI Role | Workspace |
|------|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| T0 | No Ory | /start in bot (telegram_id) + 30-day trial | Reference | Bot only (trial: all functions) |
| T1 | Start | Ory registration (UUID) + 30-day trial | Assistant | Bot only (trial: all functions) |
| T2 | Learning | БР subscription (system-school.ru) | Expert | Bot + content |
| T3 | Personalization | Digital Twin | Mentor | + Digital Twin |
| T4 | Creation (IWE) | setup.sh | Co-thinker | + Git + Claude Code + Strategist |

> **T0/T1 — current nomenclature.** Old names (T1_NEW, T1_START) are deprecated and not used. T5-T9 are reserved.

**Orthogonal axes (assigned):**

| Axis | Tiers | What it gives | Requires |
|------|-------|--------------|---------|
| TM (mentor) | TM1-TM3 | Homework review panel, groups | T2+ |
| TA (administrator) | TA1-TA4 | Stream management, finances, access | T1+ |
| TD (developer) | TD1 | Source code, Deployment, Template management | T2+ |

Each T tier is a Configuration of 5 dimensions: Knowledge, data, AI Role, actions, workspace. TM/TA/TD axes are orthogonal: one person = T + TM? + TA? + TD?. Platform owner = T4 + TA4 + TD1.

### 9.2. Tier-to-perimeter mapping

| Tier | Perimeters | What is available |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| T0-T3 | L2 (Platform) | Platform services through the bot |
| T4 | L3 → L4 | Template is instantiated into Personal IWE |
| TD1 | L2 + L3 | Platform and Template development |

### 9.3. Bot (@aist_me_bot)

The Telegram bot is the primary entry point for T1-T3. For T4+ users, the bot remains useful for quick actions.

**Bot capabilities:**

| Capability | Command / action | Tier |
|------------|-----------------|------|
| Knowledge base search | Any question | T1+ |
| Marathons and programs | `/programs` | T2+ |
| Notes (fleeting notes) | `.text` or `.` + reply | T2+ |
| Digital Twin | `/twin` | T3+ |
| Personalized responses | Auto (from Twin) | T3+ |
| Class schedule | `/schedule` | T2+ |

**Connection with exocortex:** The bot syncs fleeting notes → `DS-strategy/inbox/fleeting-notes.md`. The Strategist sees them during Note-Review.

**Where to study:**

### 9.4. IWE processes and Scenarios

#### Distinction: Process / Service / Scenario

| Term | What | Analogy |
|------|------|---------|
| **Process** | Logic within a single system | Room |
| **Service** | Entry point into a process | Door |
| **Scenario** | Cross-system path (ownership changes) | Path through buildings |

#### Key Scenarios

**User:**
- 1.1: Work Session (Open → Work → Close)
- 1.2: Weekly Strategy Session (Week-Review → Session-Prep → Strategy-Session)
- 1.3: Daily cycle (DayPlan → focus → DayClose)

**Platform:**
- 2.1: Day-Close (commit collection, plan updates, backup)
- 2.2: Exocortex backup (memory/ → DS-strategy/)
- 2.3: Ontology sync (Pack → master)
- 2.4: File sync (GitHub → local)
- 2.5: Template sync (author → FMT-exocortex-template)
- 2.6: Pack projection (Pack → Downstream)

**Where to study:**
- [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) § 3 — Distinction and placement
- `DS-ecosystem-development/PROCESSES.md` — all Scenarios (ecosystem governance repository, created locally during Deployment, not published on GitHub)

## 10. Growth and development

### 10.1. Creating your own Pack

**When to create:**
- You regularly work in one domain
- Preserving Knowledge between Sessions is important
- You want Claude to know the terms and patterns of your domain

**How to create:** type `/pack-new` in Claude Code (or "I want to create a pack", "new pack").

The Skill will guide you through 5 steps:
1. Verify/clone FPF and SPF (if not present)
2. Define the domain through 3 questions (SPF §01)
3. Suggest 2-3 name options → you choose
4. Create the `PACK-{slug}/` scaffold + starter files
5. Show the Roadmap for populating Ф1-Ф6

**Roadmap after creation:**

| Phase | What to do | Time |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Ф1. Distinctions | 7-10 domain Distinctions (SPF §03) | 1-2h |
| Ф2. Entities | Roles, Work Products, Methods — enumeration (SPF §04) | 1-2h |
| Ф3. Methods | Describe key Methods (SPF §07) | 2-4h |
| Ф4. Work Products | Artifacts + Definition of Done (SPF §07) | 1-2h |
| Ф5. Failure modes | 5-10 typical errors (SPF §08) | 1h |
| Ф6. SoTA | Sources, Knowledge version (SPF §09) | 1-2h |

Tool for populating: `/ke` — captures Knowledge into Pack during work.

### 10.2. New agents and tools

Before adding — IntegrationGate (§ 8.4). After defining:

| Component | Type | Description location | Implementation location |
|-----------|------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Extractor | Agent (Grade 2) | DP.ROLE.001 R2 | DS-ai-systems/extractor/ |
| Synchronizer | Agent + Tool | DP.ROLE.001 R8 | DS-ai-systems/synchronizer/ |

**Principle:** Minimum complexity at the start. The Strategist alone is sufficient for the first months. Extractor — when Pack reaches 10+ entities. Synchronizer — when there are 3+ Repositories.

### 10.3. MAPSTRATEGIC.md: strategy for each system

When you create a new repository, add `MAPSTRATEGIC.md`:

```markdown
# MAPSTRATEGIC: {System name}

## Current phase
{Description: what tasks are being solved now}

## Next phase
{Where the system is heading}

## Horizon
{Long-term vision}
```

The Strategist reads all MAPSTRATEGIC files during Session-Prep and aggregates them into `Strategy.md`.

### 10.4. How to develop IWE independently

**Principle:** Start with the minimum, add complexity as you grow.

```
Day 1:       setup.sh → FMT (fork) + DS-strategy          ← start
Week 1:      Daily work with Claude Code + Strategist      ← habit
Weeks 2-4:   First PACK-{domain}                          ← Knowledge formalization
Months 2-3:  DS-{projects} (code, content)                ← creation
As you grow: Extractor, Synchronizer, your own Format     ← scaling
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Do not clone** all Repositories at once — start with FMT + DS-strategy
- **Do not create a Pack** until you have defined your domain and accumulated captures
- **Do not add agents** until you can manage without them (IntegrationGate, § 8.4)
- **Clone SPF** only when you are ready to create a Pack (read-only reference)

### Typical problems and solutions

#### "Claude loses context between Sessions"

**What happens.** You describe a task in detail in the chat — Claude understands it and works on it. New Session — as if nothing happened.

**Why.** Claude Code does not "remember" the chat. Between Sessions, only what is written to files is preserved: MEMORY.md, CLAUDE.md, memory/*.md, WP files in inbox/. If information stayed only in the chat — it is gone.

**What to do.**
1. **WP file = permanent task memory.** When creating a Work Product through WP Gate, Claude records context in `DS-strategy/inbox/WP-{N}-slug.md`. In the next Session, it reads this file and restores context.
2. **If the WP file was not created** — the task was probably assessed as ≤2h and ≤1 Session. Say: *"Create a context file for this task."* Or add a rule to `<repo>/CLAUDE.md`: *"Always create a WP file when adding a Work Product."*
3. **Bulk task intake** (from Obsidian, notes, Backlog): create one Work Product "Triage tasks from [source]". Result = a set of WP files in inbox/ with full context for each task. Then sort them by Dissatisfactions during a Strategy Session.

**Key point:** Claude does not lose context — it does not record it unless told where to. Close Protocol (§ 5.1) + WP files solve this.

#### "Pack is not used during work"

**What happens.** You placed Knowledge in a Pack repository. But when working, Claude does not see it or take it into account.

**Why.** Claude automatically sees only 3 things: MEMORY.md, CLAUDE.md, memory/*.md. Pack repositories are files on disk that Claude does not read without an explicit command.

**Three ways to connect Pack** (from simple to powerful):

| Method | When | What to do |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **1. Direct link** | Pack <50 files | Add the path to Pack in `memory/navigation.md`. When setting a task, say: *"Context: see Pack-X/entity-Y.md"* |
| **2. Index in CLAUDE.md** | Pack 50-100 files | Add a list of key Pack entities to `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` or `memory/navigation.md` |
| **3. Gateway MCP** | Pack >100 files | Set up knowledge search through Gateway for your Pack (DP.IWE.002 § 7.1). Claude will be able to search the entire Knowledge base |

**Practical minimum:** Add a section with links to your Pack to `memory/navigation.md`:
```
## My Pack repositories
| Pack | Path | Topic |
|------|------|-------|
| PACK-my-domain | ~/IWE/PACK-my-domain/ | Key entities of my domain |
```

#### "I do not understand what goes where"

**One-line rule:** if Claude must see this **every** Session — MEMORY.md or CLAUDE.md. Everything else — files that Claude reads on demand.

| What | Where | Why there |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Week task list (Work Products) | `MEMORY.md` | Claude sees every Session, checks via WP Gate |
| Rules for all projects | `~/IWE/CLAUDE.md` | Claude sees every Session |
| Rules for one project | `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` | Claude sees when working in that repository |
| Reference (terms, checklists) | `memory/*.md` | Claude reads by trigger (§ 5.2) |
| Details of each task | `DS-strategy/inbox/WP-*.md` | Claude reads when opening the task (Ritual, step 3) |
| Domain Knowledge | Pack repositories | Claude reads on explicit request or via MCP |
| Strategy, Dissatisfactions | `DS-strategy/docs/` | Strategist (R1) uses during planning |

**Where memory/ is physically located:** `~/.claude/projects/{workspace-hash}/memory/`. This is a hidden Claude Code folder. Backup → `DS-strategy/exocortex/`.

#### "Work Products are not created automatically"

WP Gate **must** trigger for every assignment. If it does not trigger, check:

1. **Is CLAUDE.md in place?** The file `~/IWE/CLAUDE.md` must exist and contain the "Session stages — OWC" section.
2. **Is MEMORY.md in place?** `~/.claude/projects/{workspace-hash}/memory/MEMORY.md` must contain the "Work Products of the current week" table.
3. **Is protocol-open.md in place?** `memory/protocol-open.md` alongside MEMORY.md.
4. **Is the task >15 min?** Tasks ≤15 min are an exception to WP Gate.
5. **Model?** Opus follows Protocols more reliably. Sonnet may skip steps. Opus is recommended for initial Sessions. Haiku is only for trivial tasks (renaming, Formatting, searching) and cron agents.

If everything is in place but WP Gate still does not trigger — verify that CLAUDE.md contains the line: *"WP Gate: For ANY assignment → Opening Protocol."*

#### "What can I change in CLAUDE.md, and what cannot I change?"

| Zone | Can change? | Examples |
|------|------------|---------|
| **My rules** | Yes, freely | "Always write commits in Russian", "Use pytest" |
| **MEMORY.md** | Yes, it is your data | Tasks, statuses, notes |
| **memory/*.md** | With care | Adding lessons is fine. Changing Protocols — only with understanding of consequences |
| **Root CLAUDE.md** (standard) | With a caveat | update.sh will overwrite the standard part. Your additions go at the end of sections |

**Safe pattern:** Add your rules to `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` (not affected by update.sh).

#### "Why this folder structure?"

```
DS-strategy/
├── docs/        ← Long-lived (strategy, Dissatisfactions) — changes rarely
├── current/     ← Current (week/day plan) — changes daily
├── inbox/       ← Incoming (task contexts, notes) — processed and cleared
├── drafts/      ← Drafts (posts, ideas) — TTL ≤7 days
├── archive/     ← Closed (completed plans) — for Retrospective
└── exocortex/   ← Backup of memory/ — safety net
```

Pattern **Inbox → Processing → Archive**: incoming items are processed → result goes to docs/ or Pack → source is archived. Nothing accumulates uncontrollably.

You can change it, but preserve the "active / incoming / closed" separation — without it, inbox will grow indefinitely.

#### "What can the Strategist do?"

Main Scenarios:

| # | Scenario | Launch | What it does | Result |
|---|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Day Open** | Morning (trigger) | 7 steps: yesterday → plan → self-development → pomodoros → IWE → world → record | DayPlan |
| 2 | **Day Close** | Evening (trigger) | Results → what was learned → acknowledgment → tomorrow's setup | Updated DayPlan |
| 3 | session-prep | Monday morning (auto) | Analysis of last week + MAPSTRATEGIC from all repositories | Draft WeekPlan |
| 3b | strategy-session | Manually | Interactive breakdown of Dissatisfactions → Priorities | Approved WeekPlan |
| 4 | week-review | Sunday evening (auto) | WakaTime metrics + what was done + lessons | "W{N} Results" section in WeekPlan |
| 5 | add-wp | Manually | Add a new task to the plan (4 places) | Updated WeekPlan + WP file |
| 6 | note-review | As needed | Classify notes → Pack/inbox/archive | Routed notes |

**The Strategist cannot:** write code, access Pack without MCP, deploy. It plans, reflects, and routes.

#### "How to work with IWE on two devices (laptop + desktop)?"

**What happens.** You have two computers (possibly on different operating systems). You need an identical Environment and the ability to switch between them.

**Architecture.** IWE consists of layers with different synchronization mechanisms:

| # | Layer | Mechanism | Cross-OS |
|---|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Repositories (code, Pack, DS) | git push/pull | Yes |
| 2 | Exocortex (CLAUDE.md, memory/) | git backup in DS-strategy → restore on second device | Yes |
| 3 | Claude Code config (.claude/) | Part in git (exocortex backup), part local | Yes (JSON) |
| 4 | VS Code | Settings Sync (built-in, via GitHub) | Yes |
| 5 | MCP servers | Config Template + envsubst (paths differ between OS) | Template + platform-specific |
| 6 | Secrets (.env, API keys) | Password manager (1Password CLI / Bitwarden CLI) | Yes |
| 7 | Cron/LaunchAgents | macOS: plist. Linux: systemd/cron. Setup Script in repository | Different formats |
| 8 | Packages (brew, apt) | Brewfile (macOS) + Linux equivalent | Setup Script |

**Critical rule: Push before switch.** Before switching to another device — push all dirty repositories. Check:

```bash
for repo in ~/IWE/*/; do
  [ -d "$repo/.git" ] && git -C "$repo" status --porcelain | grep -q . && echo "DIRTY: $repo"
done
```

**Cross-OS notes:**
- **Paths:** Use `~/IWE/` (tilde is cross-platform), or variable `$IWE_HOME`
- **Symlinks:** `memory/` → `.claude/...` — each device creates its own symlinks via `setup.sh`
- **LaunchAgents vs systemd:** Templates for both are stored in the repository, `setup.sh` installs the appropriate one
- **MCP paths:** `claude_desktop_config.json` contains absolute paths — use Template + envsubst or platform-specific configs
- **Line endings:** `.gitattributes` with `* text=auto`

**Bootstrapping a new device:**

```bash
git clone <all-repos> ~/IWE/
cd ~/IWE && ./setup.sh   # creates symlinks, installs packages, configures cron
```

`setup.sh` detects the OS (`uname`) and performs the appropriate actions. It lives in DS-ecosystem-development (local governance repository) or a dotfiles repository.

**Where:** § 2.2 (from Template to workspace), § 5.2 (memory)

#### "Windows + WSL: step-by-step setup"

**What happens.** You are on Windows. Claude Code is installed, but it is unclear which terminal to use — Git Bash (MINGW64) or WSL.

**Answer: use the WSL terminal inside VS Code.** Git Bash is not suitable — it does not support the full Linux stack that Claude Code and MCP servers require.

**Step by step:**
1. Install WSL: `wsl --install` in PowerShell (as administrator)
2. Inside WSL: `mkdir -p ~/IWE && cd ~/IWE` — all Repositories must be in the WSL file system, **not** in `/mnt/c/`
3. VS Code: install the "WSL" extension (ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)
4. Open VS Code: `code .` from the WSL terminal → VS Code will connect to WSL
5. Terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+\`) → confirm it is WSL (bash/zsh), not PowerShell/MINGW64
6. Claude Code: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` inside WSL
7. `cd ~/IWE && claude` — ready

**Why not Git Bash?** MINGW64 emulates Linux commands on top of Windows, but MCP servers, Node.js scripts, and cron tasks are designed for a full Linux stack. In Git Bash they either do not work or work unstably.

**Why files in WSL, not on the Windows drive?** The WSL file system (`~/`) is 5-10x faster than accessing `/mnt/c/` (Windows drive through WSL). Watch scripts, git operations, and MCP indexing on `/mnt/c/` are critically slow.

#### "I do not understand what to write in notes"

**What happens.** You see the note function in the bot (`.text`), but do not understand — what should go there? Daily chores? Ideas? Everything?

**Rule:** notes = incoming stream for intellectual work (inbox). Record:
- **Thoughts and ideas** — things that come to mind during the day that you do not want to lose
- **Observations from reading** — noticed something useful in a book/article → `.text`
- **Questions for review** — did not understand something in a course → `.why is a meta-meta-model needed?`
- **Captures** — Knowledge that needs to be formalized in Pack

**Do not record:**
- Daily chores ("buy oil") — use to-do applications for that (Todoist, Apple Reminders)
- Exact quotes without your own interpretation — a quote without a thought is dead text

**Note lifecycle:** `.text` → bot saves → accumulates → Note-Review (Strategist or manually) → routing: to Pack (Knowledge), to Work Product (task), or archive (no longer relevant).

#### "The bot answers something other than what I asked"

**What happens.** You ask the bot a question, and the answer is either off-topic, too superficial, or cuts off.

**Three causes and solutions:**

| Cause | How to recognize | What to do |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Question outside Knowledge base** | Bot responds with generic phrases, not referencing specific documents | The bot knows what is in the Knowledge base (Gateway iwe-knowledge). Ask more precisely: "What does course X say about Y?" instead of the abstract "tell me about Y" |
| **Long answer is cut off** | Text ends in the middle of a sentence | Telegram limits message length. Ask: "continue" or "give a brief version" |
| **Context lost** | Bot does not remember what you asked a minute ago | Each question in Consultation mode is a separate request. Formulate the question completely, without references to "as I already said" |

**If the answer is completely wrong** — give a 👎. This triggers automatic classification (feedback_triage), and the problem will appear in the developer's report.
