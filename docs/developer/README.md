# Where to Start as an IWE Developer

> **This is the only reference a newcomer needs.** Read top to bottom — in 10 minutes you will understand what to do and complete your first task.

Development in IWE follows a **Pipeline of 6 stations** (Formulation → Opening → Design → Work → Verification → Closing — described in detail in the [«One-Task Cycle»](#one-task-cycle-6-stations) section below and in the [developer guide](developer-guide.md)). Every task travels from formulation to closing. The output is not only code but also captured Knowledge — this is called the **dual output**. You are a T4+ developer: you pick up a task card, move through the stations, and submit a Pull Request for Review.

## Your Role in This System

There are two ways to contribute to the Platform. Do not confuse them:

- **Leave a comment** (done by T1–T3 users) — you submit a bug or idea, and someone else decides what to do with it. You do not touch the code.
- **Do the work** (that is you, T4+) — you pick up a card, write the code and Knowledge yourself, and submit the Pull Request yourself. Your work merges into the Platform.

In short: some people **say what to fix**, you **fix it**. That is the difference between a volunteer leaving a comment and a team developer.

## Your First Day — 3 Steps

1. **Understand the rules.** Read the [developer guide](developer-guide.md) — it covers the 6 stations on one page, explains the dual output, and identifies who accepts your code. Takes 5 minutes.
2. **Get the task Template.** Copy the [card Template](card-template.md) into your tasks folder and fill it in: what you are doing, what will appear in the code, and what Knowledge you will capture.
3. **Complete the 6 stations and submit a Pull Request.** The card guides you through the stations. The output is code + capture (a Distinction or a note in Memory). The lead developer accepts the merge.

## Do This Inside Your IWE

You do not need to move through the Pipeline manually. You do it **inside your own IWE** — your workspace with an agent (Claude or Kimi), Memory, and Protocols. Set it up once, and the agent will guide you through the stations from that point on.

1. **Set up your IWE.** Run the Template setup (`bash setup.sh`). You will get: an agent, instructions, this guide, and the card Template — locally, under your account. All team developers use the same Template, so everyone speaks the same language.
2. **Load the team's working Repositories.** Clone into your workspace (`~/IWE/`) the Repositories where you will work on tasks: the Service code and the Knowledge base (Pack). Without them, the agent has nowhere to work. Before each task, it will pull the latest version (`git pull`) so you do not edit stale code. When working in a shared Repository with others, the agent will mark your active files to avoid conflicts. **If you are improving the Template itself** (not a team product), the target Repository is your fork of `FMT-exocortex-template` — no separate Service needs to be cloned.
3. **Open a task through the agent (WP Gate).** Tell the agent what you are doing. It will run the Opening ritual on its own: it will declare the Role, the Work, the Verification class, the estimate, and the model, then wait for your confirmation. This is the Opening station.
4. **The agent guides you through the stations.** It knows the framework from its own instructions (Opening/Work/Closing, WP Gate, dual output). It takes the full 6-station scheme from the [guide](developer-guide.md) — at the start of work, ask it to read the guide so it does not skip Verification and does not forget the capture. You write the code; the agent assists and checks.
5. **Knowledge accumulates in your Memory.** Every Distinction, lesson, and note (capture) goes into your exocortex (IWE's external Memory). Nothing is lost between tasks — the next time, the agent will recall it.
6. **Run the agent's checklist before submitting a Pull Request.** It will run through the checklist or tests for the Verification class. When everything is green, submit the Pull Request.

> **The key point:** your IWE is not a code editor — it is a workspace that remembers your work and enforces Pipeline Discipline for you. The more tasks you complete, the smarter your personal Memory becomes.

## What to Read (As Needed)

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Developer guide](developer-guide.md) | The essentials: 6 stations, dual output, WP Gate, who merges. Read this **first**. |
| [Task card Template](card-template.md) | Copy and fill in for your task. |
| [T0–T4 learning path](../LEARNING-PATH.md) | If you do not know your access tier, start here. |
| Developer Roles (full definitions are in the team Pack, `DP.ROLE.068`–`072`, **available to members only**) | In brief: the Formulator defines the task and acceptance criteria; the Architect selects the method and fits the solution into the Template; the Executor writes the code and capture. External forkers cannot resolve Pack codes — the summary above is sufficient. |
| Pipeline promise (`DP.SC.171`, team Pack, **members only**) | The contract: what the Pipeline guarantees and how user feedback is handled. External forkers do not need this to work. |
| Example of a completed card (`inbox/tasks/` in the team workspace) | Shows what a finished card looks like — use it as a reference (external forkers do not have access to the team workspace — refer to the [Template](card-template.md)). |

## One-Task Cycle (6 Stations)

**Formulation → Opening → Design → Work → Verification → Closing.**

Each station is described in detail in the [guide](developer-guide.md). In brief: draft the task → confirm with the pilot (WP Gate) → design → produce code **together with** a Knowledge record → verify against the Verification class → Pull Request and merge.

**Dual output is the rule.** A task that leaves only code with no captured Knowledge is considered **incomplete**.

When you open a Pull Request, a Template with a 6-station checklist will appear — fill it in honestly. The reviewer can immediately see that the Pipeline was completed.

## Entry Barrier and Who Accepts Code

- The Pipeline is for **T4+** developers. If your level is lower, the path forward is described in [LEARNING-PATH.md](../LEARNING-PATH.md) (those are development programs, not this Pipeline).
- **Only** the lead developer (TD1+TA4) or the pilot accepts merges. No one else — without explicit delegation.
- Stuck longer than the estimate? Do not stall in silence — escalate to the lead developer or the pilot.
