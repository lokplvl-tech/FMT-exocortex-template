## What IWE Is

IWE (Intellectual Work Environment) is an intelligent work environment. It is described through five aspects (FPF A.7: **Role → Method → Work Product**):

| Aspect | What | Examples |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Systems** | Programs with 4D boundaries | Claude Code, Telegram bot, MCP servers, WakaTime, Git, exocortex (files), Neon DB |
| **Descriptions** | Knowledge loaded into systems | FPF/SPF/ZP, Pack entities, Role prompts, exocortex content |
| **Roles** | Function, not performer | Strategist (R1) ← Claude, Extractor (R2), Synchronizer (R8), User ← Human |
| **Methods** | "How to do" procedures | OWC Protocol, Capture-to-Pack, ArchGate, KE, Note-Review |
| **Work Products** | What is produced | DS-strategy, Pack documents, DS-projects, digital twin events |

Full architectural model: [LEARNING-PATH.md § 1.2](LEARNING-PATH.md). Source-of-truth: `DP.IWE.001` (via Gateway: `knowledge_search("IWE архитектура")`).

## Installation Requirements

### Required
- macOS, Linux, or Windows (via WSL)
- Git + GitHub account + GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Node.js v18+ and npm
- Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Anthropic subscription: **Claude Pro** ($20/month) — recommended for getting started. If needed — **Claude Max** (~$100/month) for unlimited message usage.

### Optional
- VS Code (recommended) or any editor with a terminal. Claude Code is a CLI and runs in any terminal (Terminal.app, iTerm2, etc.). VS Code is convenient: editor + terminal + Claude Code extension in one window.
- Telegram (@aist_me_bot) — for notes
- WakaTime — work time tracking

---

## How to Install IWE

**Installation time: 30–60 minutes** (depends on terminal experience).

Detailed step-by-step guide (including how to open a terminal, install all dependencies, and what to do when something goes wrong): **[SETUP-GUIDE.md](SETUP-GUIDE.md)**

Installation result:
- A fork of the exocortex Template in your GitHub
- CLAUDE.md and memory/ — configured for you
- Strategist (AI agent) — on automatic schedule
- DS-strategy — private repo for planning

---

## Knowledge Access (MCP)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the Protocol through which Claude Code connects to the Platform knowledge base. A single Gateway server aggregates all backends:

| Server | What it provides | Tools |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **iwe-knowledge** (Gateway: `mcp.aisystant.com/mcp`) | Search across Pack repos, guides, DS (~5400 documents) + digital twin | `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_get_document`, `knowledge_list_sources`, `dt_read_digital_twin`, `dt_write_digital_twin`, `dt_describe_by_path` |

> Search guides: `knowledge_search("query", source_type="guides")`.

MCP connects via https://claude.ai/settings/connectors (see SETUP-GUIDE §1.3b). To verify: run `/mcp` in Claude Code → servers show Connected. Ask "Find documents about principles" — Claude uses `knowledge_search`.

---

## Three Roles in IWE

> The exocortex Template includes **3 Roles** available immediately: Strategist, Extractor, Synchronizer. The Platform supports 21 Roles — they are activated as the system develops.
> Full Role Registry: `DP.ROLE.001` (via Gateway: `knowledge_search("реестр ролей агентов")`).

### Strategist (R1)
Planning and reflection. Every morning (Tue–Sun) generates a day plan from yesterday's commits. Monday — preparation for the weekly session. Evening (23:00) — processes notes from Telegram.

Manual launch (in terminal or VS Code integrated terminal):
```bash
bash ~/IWE/FMT-exocortex-template/roles/strategist/scripts/strategist.sh day-plan
```

### Extractor (R2)
Extracts Knowledge into Pack Repositories. 4 scenarios: session-close (on session close), on-demand (on request), inbox-check (every 3 hours), knowledge-audit (completeness audit).

Always proposes, never writes without approval (human-in-the-loop).

Installation (in terminal): `bash ~/IWE/FMT-exocortex-template/roles/extractor/install.sh`

### Synchronizer (R8)
Central dispatcher (bash, not AI). Manages the schedule of all Roles, sends Telegram notifications, performs nightly code review.

Installation (in terminal): `bash ~/IWE/FMT-exocortex-template/roles/synchronizer/install.sh`

---

## OWC Protocol (Daily Work)

Each session in Claude Code has three stages:

**Opening.** You give a task → Claude checks WP Gate (is it in the weekly plan?). If not — proposes to add it. Announces the Role, Method, and estimate.

**Work.** Claude executes the task. At Work milestones it captures Knowledge: "Capture: [what] → [where]".

**Closing.** Say "close" → Claude commits, pushes, updates memory, creates a Backup.

---

## Memory (3 Layers)

| Layer | File | When loaded |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Operational | `memory/MEMORY.md` | Always (auto-context) |
| Rules | `CLAUDE.md` | Always (auto-context) |
| Reference | `memory/*.md` | On request |

MEMORY.md — personal (current tasks, weekly Work Products). Edited every session.
`DS-strategy/docs/WP-REGISTRY.md` — full Registry of all Work Products from most recent to first (DP.WP.015). Updated on Close when status changes.
All other memory/*.md — Platform files. Updated from upstream via `update.sh`.

---

## Updating IWE

```bash
cd ~/IWE/FMT-exocortex-template
bash update.sh          # update
bash update.sh --check  # check without applying
```

Updated: CLAUDE.md, memory/ (except MEMORY.md), Role prompts, Scripts.
Not touched: MEMORY.md, DS-strategy/, routing.md, personal settings.

---

## Telegram Notes

The @aist_me_bot bot accepts notes:
- `.Note text` (dot + text)
- `.` + reply/forward to a message

Notes go into `DS-strategy/inbox/fleeting-notes.md`. The Strategist processes them in the evening (Note-Review).

---

## Common Issues

**Claude Code does not start** — check your Anthropic subscription and run `claude --version`. You can start with a Pro plan ($20/month). If needed — Max (~$100/month).

**Strategist does not generate a plan** — macOS: `launchctl list | grep strategist`. Linux: `systemctl --user list-timers | grep strategist`. If missing — run `bash roles/strategist/install.sh`.

**MEMORY.md does not load** — check the path: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-<username>-IWE/memory/MEMORY.md`. The directory name equals the workspace path with dashes.

**DS-strategy not created** — run manually: `mkdir -p ~/IWE/DS-strategy/{current,inbox,docs,archive} && cd ~/IWE/DS-strategy && git init`.

**Notes not arriving from Telegram** — check your subscription in @aist_me_bot. Format: dot + text (`.My note`).

**MCP not working (Claude does not search the knowledge base)** — check the connection: run `/mcp` in Claude Code. Servers must show Connected. If missing — add via https://claude.ai/settings/connectors (see SETUP-GUIDE §1.3b).

**How to configure Telegram notifications** — create `~/.config/aist/env`:
```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-token"
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="your-id"
```

## Creating a Pack (Domain Knowledge Base)

A Pack is a Repository with formalized Domain Knowledge. It is the source-of-truth: everything Claude must know about the Domain lives here.

**When you need a Pack:**
- You work regularly in one area
- You want Claude to know the terms and patterns of your Domain
- You are tired of repeating context in every session

**How to create one:** type `/pack-new` in Claude Code.

The Skill guides you through: Domain selection → Pack name → structure → content Roadmap.

**After creating a Pack** — fill it using `/ke` (Knowledge Extraction). Capture Knowledge as you work.
