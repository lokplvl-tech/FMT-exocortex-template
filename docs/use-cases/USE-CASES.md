## SC.001: Day Planning

**Promise:** Start the work day with clear priorities — not a blank screen.

**What you get:**
- DayPlan — a structured daily plan
- Priorities from WeekPlan + carry-over from yesterday
- Events from Google Calendar
- A recommendation on where to start

**How it works:** The strategist agent automatically generates DayPlan by 04:00. In the morning you run Morning Check — review overnight services and begin working from the plan.

---

## SC.002: Week Planning and Review

**Promise:** Align work with strategy every week, track Progress, and adjust course.

**What you get:**
- WeekPlan — weekly plan with Work Products, priorities, and budget (includes "Results W{N}" section — last week's outcomes)
- Ability to adjust priorities and add Work Products during the week

**How it works:** By Monday morning, Session Prep (plan draft) and Week Review (outcomes) are ready. In the Strategy Session you approve the plan. During the week — Check Plan, Update Priorities, Add Workproduct.

---

## SC.003: Learning and Development

**Promise:** Develop Competencies through personalized interaction with an AI consultant.

**What you get:**
- Answers to Domain questions (based on Pack Knowledge)
- Homework review with feedback at Bloom levels
- Knowledge feed — personalized materials on a schedule
- Marathons — step-by-step development programs

**How it works:** Via the Telegram bot. Ask a question → get an answer in under 3 seconds. Submit homework → receive an Assessment. The feed and marathons arrive on schedule.

---

## SC.004: Knowledge Capture and Extraction

**Promise:** No discovered Knowledge is ever lost.

**What you get:**
- Fast thought capture (TG → file, < 2 min)
- Capture-to-Pack — Knowledge announced at the moment of discovery
- Extraction Report — formalized Pack entities
- Updated Ontology for knowledge search via Gateway

**How it works:** send the bot a note message in TG — within 2 minutes it appears in fleeting-notes.md. During work Sessions, Claude announces Captures. Overnight, the extractor formalizes captures into Pack entities.

---

## SC.005: Content Publishing

**Promise:** Content is published to the club automatically on schedule.

**What you get:**
- Auto-scanning of ready texts (status: ready)
- Scheduled publishing to Discourse (systemsworld.club)
- Manual publishing via /club publish
- Notifications about new comments in TG

**How it works:** Set a text to `status: ready` → the system picks it up → publishes it to the scheduled slot → notifies you about comments.

---

## SC.006: Automated Maintenance

**Promise:** The Platform runs itself — data syncs, Templates update.

**What you get:**
- All ⏰ services run on schedule without intervention
- Daily report on commits across all repositories
- Current YAML Projections for knowledge search via Gateway
- FMT Template updated and verified automatically

**How it works:** Scheduler Dispatch (10×/day) launches agents. Code Scan, Pack Projection, Template Sync — all run overnight. By morning — everything is ready.

---

## SC.007: Triage and Technical Debt

**Promise:** No problem signal is ever lost.

**What you get:**
- Automatic classification of unhelpful responses with an alert
- Prioritized Backlog from feedback_triage + inbox

**How it works:** User gives 👎 → Auto-Triage classifies → alert in TG. On request — Triage Session produces a prioritized Backlog.

---

## SC.008: Self-Recovery

**Promise:** The Platform fixes common problems on its own — you do not notice failures.

**What you get:**
- L1: automatic reset of stuck users
- L2: correction of recurring errors
- L3: service restart on critical failure
- L4: escalation to GitHub Issue for unresolvable problems

**How it works:** 4 levels. Each next level activates if the previous one did not resolve the issue. Everything up to L4 (developer escalation) is fully automatic.

---

## SC.009: Analytics and Metrics

**Promise:** Make decisions based on data, not intuition.

**What you get:**
- Daily metrics collection (response quality, activity, feedback)
- On-demand report (/analytics) with trends
- Pack entity validation against SPF
- Time tracking by project (WakaTime → Week Review)

**How it works:** Metrics Collection gathers data daily. /analytics delivers a report in TG. WakaTime tracks time continuously; data is available in the dashboard and via API.

---

## SC.010: Work Rhythm (ORZ)

**Promise:** Every day and every Session is structured — nothing forgotten, everything captured.

**What you get:**
- **Day: Opening** — DayPlan ready, calendar reviewed, overnight services checked
- **Day: Work** — tasks executed within Work Products, Captures recorded at Work milestones
- **Day: Closing** — outcomes recorded, carry-over handed off, Backup made
- **Session: Opening** — WP Gate passed, Work Product defined
- **Session: Work** — task executed with Capture-to-Pack
- **Session: Closing** — KE completed, MEMORY updated, report generated

**How it works:** ORZ is a fractal pattern at two scales (day and session). Skipping Opening = unplanned work. Skipping Closing = unrecorded result. Claude Code automatically triggers the appropriate Protocols based on trigger events.

---

## SC.011: Strategy Planning

**Promise:** Dissatisfactions become priorities, and priorities become an approved plan.

**What you get:**
- Strategy Session — weekly session (Mon): dissatisfaction review, Work Product prioritization
- Session Prep — plan draft prepared by the agent before the session
- Week Review — last week's outcomes as input data
- Priority management throughout the week

**How it works:** By Monday morning the agent prepares Session Prep (WeekPlan draft) and Week Review (outcomes). In the Strategy Session you approve the plan. During the week — Check Plan, Update Priorities, Add Workproduct on request.

---

## SC.012: Onboarding

**Promise:** From first contact to first working day — without panic.

**What you get:**
- Configured bot — /start in TG, mode selected, Profile filled in
- Configured exocortex — FMT Template deployed, CLAUDE.md configured
- Use case catalog — USE-CASES.md (this file)
- First working day — Day Open completed, DayPlan created

**How it works:** Run setup.sh from the Template → exocortex deployed. /start in the bot → Profile configured. Read USE-CASES.md → understand capabilities. First Day Open → understand the ORZ rhythm.

---

## SC.013: Work Session with Claude Code

**Promise:** Every Session is productive and complete — task done, Knowledge captured.

**What you get:**
- WP Gate — task linked to a Work Product before work begins
- UC Gate — promise (SC) defined
- Completed task — code, document, Configuration
- Captures — Knowledge recorded at Work milestones
- Session Close — KE, MEMORY, report

**How it works:** You give a task → Claude checks WP Gate (is there a Work Product?) → UC Gate (which SC is involved?) → executes the work with Capture-to-Pack at Work milestones → Close with result capture.

---

## SC.014: Knowledge Formalization (Pack)

**Promise:** Domain knowledge does not stay in people's heads — it becomes formalized Pack entities.

**What you get:**
- Formalized entities — Methods, Distinctions, failure modes, SOTA, Work Products
- SPF Validation — each entity verified for format compliance
- Links via frontmatter — accessible through MAP.001
- Updated Ontology — Gateway (iwe-knowledge) receives new entities

**How it works:** Captures from work Sessions → Knowledge Extraction formalizes into Pack entities (ID, frontmatter, status) → Ontology Sync updates the knowledge index → entities are available to the bot and agents via Gateway (iwe-knowledge).

---

## SC.015: System Development (DS)

**Promise:** Every change goes through the full cycle — from promise to working service.

**What you get:**
- UC Gate passed — promise (SC) defined before work begins
- IntegrationGate — IWE perimeter, Roles, products, processes defined
- ArchGate ≥8 — solution evaluated against the seven architecture characteristics
- Working service — code, PROCESSES.md, entry in MAP.002
- Pilot test — verified before merge to production

**How it works:** Work Product from WeekPlan → UC Gate (which SC?) → IntegrationGate (which perimeter?) → ArchGate (architecture profile ≥8) → implementation on pilot → test → cherry-pick to production → MAP.002 + PROCESSES.md updated.
