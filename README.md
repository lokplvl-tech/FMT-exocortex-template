## The Problem

AI assistants can generate text, code, and answers. But most users face the same issues:

- **Context is lost.** Every new AI Session starts from scratch. Yesterday's decisions, plans, and agreements are forgotten.
- **Knowledge stays in your head.** You finish a course, read a book, solve a problem — but a month later you cannot reconstruct your chain of thought.
- **AI replaces thinking instead of amplifying it.** You get an answer, but you do not become more competent. Without AI, you are back to zero.
- **No system.** Plans live in notes, tasks live in your head, Knowledge lives in chat logs. Everything is scattered.
- **Time disappears.** It is unclear what you worked on, what you accomplished, or where you are headed.

---

## The Solution: An IDE for Thinking

**IWE (Intellectual Work Environment)** is an intellectual work environment.

Just as an IDE combines an editor, compiler, and debugger into a single environment for a developer — IWE combines Knowledge, planning, and AI agents into a single environment for thinking.

| IDE (for code) | IWE (for thinking) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Editor → write code | Exocortex → capture Knowledge |
| Compiler → checks syntax | Principles → verify correctness of decisions |
| Debugger → finds errors | ORZ Protocols (Opening→Work→Closing) → find Knowledge and context loss |
| Linter → improves quality | ArchGate → assesses architectural decisions |
| Git → change history | Strategist → work history and planning |

> **Core principle: exoskeleton, not prosthetic.** IWE amplifies your thinking — it does not replace it. After every Session you become more competent, not just more productive. See: [principles-vs-skills.md](docs/principles-vs-skills.md).

## Key IWE Terms

| Term | Description |
|--------|---------|
| **Exocortex** | Your external Memory — files containing plans, context, and conclusions that Claude reads in every Session |
| **Pack** | A formalized Knowledge base for your Domain — the single source of truth for domain Knowledge |
| **ORZ** | Opening → Work → Closing — a ritual for every Session and every day that prevents context loss |
| **ArchGate** | Structured assessment of architectural decisions across 7 characteristics (instead of "I think this is fine") |
| **Strategist** | An AI agent that automatically builds day/week plans and tracks Progress |


---

## Work Culture — A New Way to Interact With AI


### The ORZ Protocol (Opening → Work → Closing)

Every Session and every day passes through three stages:

- **Opening** — Claude reviews the plan, identifies the task, and aligns on the approach. You do not start from scratch — the AI knows the context.
- **Work** — during the work, Claude captures valuable Knowledge (Capture-to-Pack). Insights are not lost.
- **Closing** — the result is recorded, the plan is updated, and the next Session starts where you left off.

Skipping Opening = unplanned work. Skipping Closing = lost result.

### Exocortex — External Memory

Your Knowledge, principles, Distinctions, plans, and context are stored in files that Claude reads in every Session. This is not a "prompt" — it is an **accumulated base** that grows with you.

### Knowledge Formalization (Pack)

What you learn does not stay in your head. Valuable Knowledge is formalized into a Pack — a Domain passport. Pack is the single source of truth for domain Knowledge. See: [LEARNING-PATH.md](docs/LEARNING-PATH.md).

---

## Who It Is For

Every professional is drowning in information: 12+ tools (Notion, Google Docs, Slack, ChatGPT, courses...), Knowledge is scattered, nothing is connected. AI answers questions but does not know *your* context — starting from zero every time.

IWE is for those who want to change that:

- **Entrepreneurs and managers** — you strategize, make decisions, manage projects. IWE provides a system: from weekly planning to Domain Knowledge formalization.
- **Engineers and developers** — you work with code and Architecture. IWE preserves context between Sessions; the AI knows your codebase, tech debt, and Roadmap.
- **Researchers and analysts** — you study, synthesize, publish. IWE turns scattered notes into a structured Knowledge base that grows with you.
- **Everyone who does intellectual work** — and wants **symbiosis with AI**, not dependence on it. An exoskeleton for thinking, not a prosthetic.

## Use Cases

### Work Projects

| Scenario | What Happens | Details |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Product development** | Claude knows the Architecture, tech debt, and Roadmap. Every Session is a continuation, not a fresh start. | [SC.013](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc013-рабочая-сессия-с-claude-code), [SC.015](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc015-развитие-системы-ds) |
| **Documentation management** | Knowledge is captured into Pack during the work. No need to "write the docs later" — they are written as you work. | [SC.004](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc004-фиксация-и-экстракция-знаний), [SC.014](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc014-формализация-знаний-pack) |
| **Project coordination** | WeekPlan, DayPlan, Work Product registry — the Strategist helps plan and track Progress. | [SC.001](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc001-планирование-дня), [SC.002](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc002-планирование-и-ревью-недели) |
| **Review and Refactoring** | ArchGate evaluates decisions across 7 characteristics. Not "I think this is good" — a structured Assessment. | [SC.015](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc015-развитие-системы-ds) |

### Personal Development

| Scenario | What Happens | Details |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Taking a course** | Claude helps capture key ideas, asks questions to check Understanding, and connects new material to what you already know. | [SC.003](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc003-обучение-и-развитие) |
| **Writing articles** | A creative Pipeline: note → draft → outline → publication. Every Artifact is tracked. | [SC.005](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc005-публикация-контента) |
| **Strategizing** | A weekly Session: Review of the past week, planning the new one, alignment with goals. The Strategist prepares a draft — you make the decisions. | [SC.011](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc011-стратегирование) |
| **Building a Knowledge base** | Your Pack grows. After six months you have a formalized Domain Knowledge base, not a collection of notes. | [SC.014](docs/use-cases/USE-CASES.md#sc014-формализация-знаний-pack) |

## What It Looks Like in Practice

- In the morning — the Strategist has built your plan: a Telegram notification and a DayPlan file in the Repository.
- You open VS Code → `claude` → Claude knows what is in the plan and suggests starting with the top Priority.
- You work — Claude captures Knowledge as you go (Capture-to-Pack).
- You close the Session — the result is recorded, the plan is updated.
- On Monday — the Strategist prepares a draft weekly plan; you discuss it in your strategizing Session.

---

## Getting Started

**Quick start** (Git, Node.js, and Claude Code already installed): **[QUICK-START.md](docs/QUICK-START.md)** — 15 minutes to your first Session.

**Full setup** from a clean machine: **[SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md)** — 30–60 minutes including all dependency installation.

**Not on macOS or not using Claude Code?** See **[PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md)** — instructions for Kimi Code, Hermes Agent, and others.

**Different agent or LLM?** IWE is not tied to Claude. If your agent can see files in the repo folder and edit files, it will work. How to connect → [PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/IWE && cd ~/IWE
gh repo fork iwesys/IWE --clone
cd FMT-exocortex-template
bash setup.sh
```

After setup:

```bash
cd ~/IWE
claude
```

Tell Claude: **"Let's run our first strategic Session"** — and it will guide you through defining goals, creating your first plan, and configuring your Environment.

---

## Customization

IWE updates like a distribution — you receive Platform updates without losing your personal settings.

**Extensions (extensions/)** — add your own blocks to Protocols:

```bash
# Add end-of-day reflection
echo "## Day Reflection
- What was difficult?
- What would I do differently?
- What deserves recognition?" > extensions/day-close.after.md
```

**Parameters (params.yaml)** — enable or disable Protocol steps:

```yaml
reflection_enabled: true    # Enable reflection
video_check: false          # Disable video check
multiplier_enabled: true    # IWE multiplier
```

**Updates** — `bash update.sh` updates the Platform while preserving your `extensions/`, `params.yaml`, and edits in `CLAUDE.md` (3-way merge).

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need an Anthropic subscription?**
A: For a full setup (Claude Code) — Claude Pro ($20/month) is recommended. If needed, you can upgrade to Claude Max (~$100/month) for unlimited usage. For a minimal setup (`setup.sh --core`) — works with any AI CLI. See: [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

**Q: Does it work with other AI systems (not Claude)?**
A: Yes, three agents are supported out of the box:
- **Claude Code** — full support: reads `CLAUDE.md`, all Skills and Hooks work.
- **Kimi Code** (VS Code) — reads `AGENTS.md` automatically when the repo is opened. Customization: `extensions/` or `AGENTS-agent-blocks.md`. Skills (`/day-open` etc.) via Claude Code.
- **Hermes Agent** — connect the aisystant MCP through Hermes settings and it receives instructions automatically.

For other agents (Cursor, Copilot, Gemini), adaptation is required. See: [PORTABILITY.md](docs/PORTABILITY.md).
The minimal setup (`setup.sh --core`) works without binding to a specific agent.

**Q: Does it work on Linux/Windows?**
A: Yes. The core runs on any OS. Strategist automation: macOS — launchd, Linux — cron, Windows — WSL. See: [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

**Q: What if my computer is off or sleeping — will automation stop?**
A: Cloud Scheduler (GitHub Actions) runs in the cloud even when your computer is off. For local agents: scripts automatically prevent sleep during execution (macOS: `caffeinate`, Linux: `systemd-inhibit`). For laptops, it is recommended to configure automatic wake and disable idle sleep — see [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

**Q: What is a Pack?**
A: A formalized Knowledge Domain — the single source of truth for domain Knowledge. See: [LEARNING-PATH.md](docs/LEARNING-PATH.md).

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Three protection zones: local, GitHub (private repositories), Platform (per-user isolation). See: [DATA-POLICY.md](docs/DATA-POLICY.md).

**Q: How is IWE different from Obsidian / Notion / Logseq?**
A: Obsidian is a note storage tool. IWE is a **work environment** with Protocols, AI agents, and Knowledge formalization. You can use Obsidian inside IWE for notes, but IWE provides structure, planning, and Competency accumulation.

**Q: Do I need to know how to program?**
A: No. The template is a ready-made Configuration. Setup runs through `setup.sh`. Work happens through Claude Code in natural language.

**Q: Can I use it without the Strategist?**
A: Yes. Claude Code + `CLAUDE.md` + `memory/` work fully on their own. The Strategist automates planning. Without it, you plan manually.

**Q: How do I configure my strategizing day?**
A: In `memory/day-rhythm-config.yaml`, change `strategy_day: sunday` to the day you want. See: [LEARNING-PATH.md](docs/LEARNING-PATH.md).

**Q: The clone ended up in `~` instead of `~/IWE`?**
A: All setup commands must be run in the same terminal. Opening a new terminal resets the working directory to `~`. Delete the folder from `~` and repeat from `cd ~/IWE`. See: [SETUP-GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

## IWE Community

IWE is an environment you build alone. But you develop it together.

The **IWE Community** is a closed chat for Practitioners who work within the same system: ORZ, Pack, Exocortex. A place where discussions are not about "how to write better prompts," but about how to build serious intellectual work.

### What Happens There

- **Work Product reviews** — participants share real Packs, plans, and Retrospectives. They receive feedback from people who understand what "Closing without capturing the result" means.
- **IWE setup and customization Experience** — what broke, how it was fixed, which extensions turned out to be useful.
- **Method discussions** — the ORZ fractal, ArchGate, Capture-to-Pack in Practice: what works, where theory diverges from reality.
- **Links and discoveries** — tools, patterns, SOTA that fit the IWE philosophy.

### Why This Matters

Learning the system alone is possible. But most questions arise during application: "How do I formalize this Knowledge Domain?", "Am I using ORZ correctly?", "Who has Experience with this tool?"

In the community, those questions get answered by people who have already been through it.

### Free Channels

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/iwesys/IWE/discussions) — questions, ideas, show your setup
- [Issues](https://github.com/iwesys/IWE/issues) — bug reports and feature requests

### Closed Community (Telegram)

Deep Practice, Work Product reviews, direct support. Entry — through the **"IWE for Practitioners"** seminar (5000₽) via the [@aist_me_bot](https://t.me/aist_me_bot) bot.
